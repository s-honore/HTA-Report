## HAS Commission Evaluation

### Clinical Assessment

The Commission de la Transparence evaluated Hemgenix based on:
- Clinical trial data from the HOPE-B study
- Long-term safety and efficacy considerations
- Benefit-risk profile in the target population

### Key Clinical Findings

#### Efficacy Limitations

The Commission highlighted that:
- **Hemgenix has not been evaluated in patients with endogenous FIX levels above 2%**
- This represents an important limitation in the evidence base

#### Impact of Pre-existing Antibodies

**Critical Finding:**
- Clinical data indicate that **pre-existing anti-AAV5 neutralizing antibodies above a titer of 1:678 can reduce treatment efficacy**
- In one patient with an antibody titer of **1:3212** in the Phase III study:
  - **No Factor IX expression was observed**
  - **Resumption of exogenous FIX prophylaxis was necessary**

This finding emphasizes the importance of pre-treatment antibody screening.
