## Executive Summary

The German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) conducted an early benefit assessment of onasemnogene abeparvovec (trade name: Zolgensma) following its approval in Europe. The assessment examined whether onasemnogene abeparvovec offers an added benefit compared to appropriate comparator therapies for patients with 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

### Key Conclusion

**No added benefit proven** for any of the patient groups studied. The assessment found that suitable data were not available for three of the four research questions, and the data provided for SMA type 1 were not interpretable due to significant differences in study populations.

## 1. Background and Authorization

### Marketing Authorization

Onasemnogene abeparvovec received European marketing authorization for the treatment of patients with:
- 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)
- Bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene
- Clinical diagnosis of SMA type 1, OR
- Patients with up to 3 copies of the SMN2 gene

### Mechanism of Action

Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a gene therapy that:
- Delivers a functional copy of the human SMN gene
- Uses an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector
- Provides one-time intravenous infusion
- Takes a different approach from other SMA treatments by addressing the genetic root cause

The modified virus delivers intact versions of the SMN1 gene to cell nuclei via a single dose injected into the bloodstream.

## 2. Assessment Framework

### Patient Groups Evaluated

IQWiG evaluated four distinct patient groups:

**1. SMA Type 1:**
- Patients with clinical diagnosis of SMA type 1
- Most severe form with early onset
- Historically poor prognosis

**2. SMA Type 2:**
- Patients with clinical diagnosis of SMA type 2
- Intermediate severity
- Later onset than type 1

**3. SMA Type 3:**
- Patients with clinical diagnosis of SMA type 3
- Milder form
- Later onset with slower progression

**4. Presymptomatic Patients:**
- Newborns and infants with genetic diagnosis but no symptoms
- Up to 3 copies of SMN2 gene
- Identified through genetic testing or newborn screening

### Appropriate Comparator Therapy

IQWiG identified the following appropriate comparators:

**For SMA Type 1 and Type 2:**
- **Nusinersen** (Spinraza) - approved therapy with demonstrated efficacy

**For Presymptomatic Newborns:**
- **Nusinersen** - proactive treatment option

**For SMA Type 3:**
- **Treatment of physician's choice** or **best supportive care**
- Reflects current clinical practice for this patient group

---

## 3. Assessment Results by Patient Group

### SMA Type 1 - No Added Benefit Proven

**Conclusion:** An added benefit of onasemnogene abeparvovec in comparison with nusinersen is not proven.

**Rationale:**

The drug manufacturer (Novartis) submitted indirect comparisons between study arms of onasemnogene abeparvovec trials and nusinersen trials. However, IQWiG determined these comparisons were not interpretable due to:

**1. Population Differences - Age at Treatment:**
- Children treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec were notably younger at the time of gene therapy
- Children in the nusinersen studies were older at treatment initiation
- Age at treatment is a critical prognostic factor in SMA
- Younger age at treatment generally associated with better outcomes

**2. Population Differences - Disease Severity:**
- Inclusion criteria regarding ventilation and respiratory symptoms differed significantly between studies
- Nusinersen study population had more advanced disease
- Children treated with nusinersen had a less favorable prognosis
- Different baseline respiratory support requirements

**3. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:**
- Studies used different criteria for patient eligibility
- Onasemnogene abeparvovec studies excluded more severely affected patients
- Selection bias introduced by different eligibility criteria
- Cannot assume populations are comparable

**4. Methodological Limitations:**
- Indirect comparisons only interpretable if study populations are sufficiently similar
- Significant heterogeneity between study populations
- No adjustment methods can adequately address these fundamental differences
- High risk of bias in any attempted comparison

**IQWiG Assessment:**
Such indirect comparisons are only interpretable if the study populations are sufficiently similar, which was not the case. The systematic differences in patient characteristics mean that observed differences in outcomes cannot be attributed to treatment effects alone.

### SMA Type 2 - No Suitable Data

**Conclusion:** No added benefit, as no suitable data were available.

**Rationale:**
- No adequate clinical data submitted for SMA type 2 population
- Drug manufacturer did not provide appropriate evidence
- Cannot assess added benefit without suitable data

### SMA Type 3 - No Suitable Data

**Conclusion:** No added benefit, as no suitable data were available.

**Rationale:**
- No adequate clinical data submitted for SMA type 3 population
- Drug manufacturer did not provide appropriate evidence
- Cannot assess added benefit without suitable data

### Presymptomatic Patients - No Suitable Data

**Conclusion:** No added benefit, as no suitable data were available.

**Rationale:**
- No adequate comparative data submitted for presymptomatic population
- Drug manufacturer did not provide appropriate evidence comparing to nusinersen
- Cannot assess added benefit without suitable comparative data

---

## 4. Evidence Submitted by Manufacturer

### Studies Provided

The manufacturer (Novartis) submitted data from:

**STR1VE Study:**
- Single-arm, open-label study
- SMA type 1 patients
- No direct comparator arm
- Historical comparison attempted

**START Study:**
- Earlier phase study
- Long-term follow-up data
- Single-arm design

**SPR1NT Study:**
- Presymptomatic patients
- Single-arm design
- No active comparator

### Limitations of Submitted Evidence

**Study Design Issues:**
- All submitted studies were single-arm trials
- No randomized controlled trials comparing to nusinersen
- Reliance on indirect comparisons to external data
- High risk of bias from lack of randomization

**Comparability Issues:**
- Populations not sufficiently similar for valid indirect comparison
- Different inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Different time periods of patient recruitment
- Different baseline prognostic factors

**Missing Evidence:**
- No direct comparative data for any patient group
- No adequate data for SMA type 2 or 3
- No comparative data for presymptomatic patients
- Insufficient evidence to establish added benefit

---

## 5. Methodological Critique

### IQWiG's Assessment of Manufacturer's Approach

**Critical Issues Identified:**

1. **Inappropriate Indirect Comparisons:**
   - Study populations not comparable
   - Systematic differences in prognostic factors
   - Cannot validly attribute differences to treatment
   - Results not interpretable

2. **Selection Bias:**
   - Different eligibility criteria create selection bias
   - Onasemnogene abeparvovec studies excluded more severe cases
   - Comparison groups not balanced
   - Bias favors onasemnogene abeparvovec

3. **Lack of Adjustment:**
   - No adequate methods to adjust for population differences
   - Differences too fundamental for statistical adjustment
   - Propensity score or other methods insufficient
   - Residual confounding inevitable

4. **Missing Data:**
   - Three of four patient groups lacked any suitable data
   - Manufacturer did not provide required evidence
   - Cannot demonstrate benefit without evidence
   - Burden of proof not met

### IQWiG's Methodological Standards

For benefit assessment, IQWiG requires:
- Randomized controlled trials (preferred)
- Direct comparative evidence
- Comparable patient populations if indirect comparisons used
- Adequate data quality and completeness

**Manufacturer's submission failed to meet these standards.**

## 8. Overall Assessment Conclusion

### IQWiG's Final Determination

**For all four patient groups assessed, IQWiG concluded:**

**"No added benefit proven"** relative to the appropriate comparator therapy (nusinersen or treatment of physician's choice).

### Reasoning Summary

1. **Insufficient Evidence:**
   - No adequate data for three patient groups
   - Data for SMA type 1 not interpretable

2. **Methodological Flaws:**
   - Study populations not comparable
   - Indirect comparisons invalid
   - Selection bias present
   - Cannot draw conclusions about relative efficacy

3. **Burden of Proof:**
   - Manufacturer responsible for providing adequate evidence
   - Submitted evidence insufficient
   - Cannot assume benefit without proof
   - "Not proven" does not mean "disproven" but evidence lacking

### Implications

This assessment means:
- Onasemnogene abeparvovec does not receive recognition of added benefit
- Reimbursement price based on comparator therapy
- No premium price justified based on submitted evidence
- Manufacturer may submit new evidence in future assessments

---

## 9. Regulatory vs. Benefit Assessment

### Important Distinction

**European Marketing Authorization:**
- Onasemnogene abeparvovec approved by EMA
- Met regulatory standards for safety and efficacy
- Can be prescribed in Germany and Europe

**IQWiG Benefit Assessment:**
- Separate process evaluating added benefit versus comparators
- Determines reimbursement pricing
- Higher evidentiary standards than regulatory approval
- Focuses on comparative effectiveness

**Both can be true:**
- Product is safe and effective (regulatory approval)
- Added benefit not proven versus comparator (IQWiG assessment)

## Conclusion

The IQWiG benefit assessment of onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma) concluded that an added benefit compared to appropriate comparator therapies (primarily nusinersen) was not proven for any of the evaluated patient groups with spinal muscular atrophy.

This conclusion was based on:
1. Absence of adequate data for three of four patient groups (SMA type 2, type 3, and presymptomatic)
2. Non-interpretable data for SMA type 1 due to significant population differences between studies
3. Methodological limitations precluding valid indirect comparisons

The assessment highlights the challenges of evaluating gene therapies in rare diseases where traditional randomized controlled trials may be difficult to conduct. However, IQWiG maintained that comparative evidence meeting appropriate methodological standards is necessary to demonstrate added benefit for reimbursement pricing purposes.

This "no added benefit proven" determination affects pricing but does not preclude clinical use of onasemnogene abeparvovec in Germany, as the therapy remains available and reimbursed through statutory health insurance at a price level based on the comparator therapy.

Future reassessments may be conducted if additional evidence, particularly from direct comparative studies or well-designed real-world evidence studies, becomes available to address the evidentiary gaps identified in this assessment.
