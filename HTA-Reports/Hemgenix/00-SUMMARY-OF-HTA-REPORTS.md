### 5. PBAC (Australia)
**Agency:** Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee
**File:** `/home/user/HTA-Report/HTA-Reports/Hemgenix/PBAC-Australia-Search-Results.md`
**Status:** ❌ NO REPORT FOUND

**Search Results:**
- **Comprehensive search conducted:** No PBAC HTA report or Public Summary Document identified
- **PBS Listing:** No listing found on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
- **Likely Status:** No submission made to PBAC yet, or submission in progress but not yet publicly available
- **TGA Approval:** Regulatory approval status in Australia uncertain
- **Access in Australia:** No evidence of reimbursed access as of November 2025

**Possible Explanations:**
- Manufacturer (CSL Behring) has not yet submitted for PBAC review
- Submission may be in progress but not yet reviewed

### Common Themes Across HTAs

**Positive Factors:**
1. **Significant unmet need** in hemophilia B recognized by all agencies
2. **Clinical benefit demonstrated** in reducing bleeding episodes and FIX use
3. **Rarity of condition** factored into benefit-risk assessment
4. **Potential to eliminate lifelong prophylaxis** for responders

**Concerns and Limitations:**
1. **Single-arm trial design** - no randomized comparator
2. **Limited long-term data** - durability beyond 5 years uncertain
3. **High upfront cost** - cost-effectiveness challenging
4. **Safety uncertainties:**
   - Hepatocellular carcinoma case (emphasized by France)
   - Long-term liver safety
   - Treatment failures (high AAV5 antibody patients)
5. **Small sample size** - limited by disease rarity

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Managed/conditional access** - all approving agencies
2. **Registry requirements** - France (mandatory), others recommended
3. **Specialized center delivery** - Germany (mandatory), others recommended
4. **Long-term monitoring protocols** - all agencies
5. **Evidence generation requirements** - Germany (AbD), UK (managed access)

## Clinical Evidence Base

All assessments were based primarily on:

### HOPE-B Trial (Phase III)
- **Design:** Single-arm, open-label, multicenter
- **Population:** 54 adult males with moderately severe to severe hemophilia B
- **Primary Endpoint:** Annualized bleeding rate (ABR)

**Key Results:**
- **ABR reduction:** 4.19 (baseline) → 1.51 (months 7-18 post-treatment)
- **Rate ratio:** 0.36 (64% reduction)
- **FIX activity:** Sustained increase in endogenous FIX levels
- **FIX infusion use:** Marked reduction in prophylaxis requirements

### Phase II Long-Term Follow-Up
- Extended follow-up data (up to 5 years)
- Durability of FIX expression
- Long-term safety profile

### Evidence Limitations
- No randomized controlled trial
- Comparison to historical baseline (lead-in period)
- Limited follow-up relative to lifetime benefit claim
- Small sample size
- Predominantly male, adult population

---

## Safety Profile - Key Findings Across HTAs

### Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
- **One case** in Phase III trial (12 months post-treatment)
- **France (HAS):** Causality cannot be ruled out - requires lifelong semi-annual liver surveillance
- **All agencies:** Enhanced liver monitoring recommended
- **Screening:** Ultrasound ± AFP, semi-annual to annual

### Liver Enzyme Elevations
- Common adverse event
- Managed with corticosteroid immunosuppression
- Usually transient
- Requires intensive monitoring post-treatment

### Anti-AAV5 Antibodies
- **High titers (>1:678):** Associated with reduced efficacy
- **Very high titers (e.g., 1:3212):** Complete treatment failure observed
- **Pre-treatment screening:** Mandatory
- **Implications:** Some patients ineligible for treatment

### Immunosuppression Requirements
- Corticosteroids required post-infusion
- Duration: Weeks to months
- Associated risks: Infection, metabolic effects, etc.

## Patient Selection Criteria (Synthesized from All HTAs)

### Inclusion Criteria
- **Age:** Adults (≥18 years)
- **Diagnosis:** Moderately severe to severe hemophilia B
- **Severity:** Factor IX activity ≤2 IU/dL
- **Current treatment:** Requiring or suitable for routine prophylaxis
- **Screening:** Anti-AAV5 antibody titer ≤1:678

### Exclusion Criteria
- History of Factor IX inhibitors (current or past)
- High anti-AAV5 neutralizing antibody titers (>1:678)
- Significant liver disease or abnormal liver function
- Active or chronic infections
- Conditions precluding immunosuppression

### Special Considerations
- **France:** Mandatory hepatologist evaluation
- **Germany:** Treatment at certified hemophilia centers only
- **All:** Multidisciplinary team assessment recommended

---

## Implementation Requirements Across Jurisdictions

### Treatment Delivery
- **Specialized centers:** Required (Germany) or strongly recommended (all others)
- **Multidisciplinary teams:** Hematology, hepatology (France), pharmacy, nursing
- **Expertise required:** Gene therapy, hemophilia management, long-term monitoring

### Pre-Treatment Requirements
1. **AAV5 antibody testing:** Mandatory
2. **Liver function assessment:** Complete hepatic evaluation
3. **Baseline FIX levels:** Documentation required
4. **Informed consent:** Extensive discussion of benefits, risks, uncertainties

### Post-Treatment Monitoring

**Short-Term (First 6-12 months):**
- Frequent liver function tests (weekly → monthly)
- FIX activity monitoring
- Immunosuppression management
- Adverse event surveillance

**Long-Term (Lifelong):**
- **France:** Semi-annual liver ultrasound for HCC screening (mandatory)
- **All:** Annual liver function tests
- FIX activity assessment (quarterly → annually)

## Economic Considerations

### Cost-Effectiveness Challenges
1. **Ultra-high upfront cost:** $3.5-4.7 million per patient
2. **Uncertain long-term durability:** Benefit duration beyond 5 years unknown
3. **Comparator costs:** Lifetime prophylaxis also expensive but spread over time
4. **Discount rates:** Impact of upfront payment vs. ongoing costs
5. **Treatment failures:** Some patients may require return to prophylaxis

### Value Propositions
1. **Elimination of prophylaxis:** For responders, potential lifetime freedom from infusions
2. **Bleeding reduction:** Improved outcomes, reduced complications
3. **Quality of life:** Significant improvements for patients
4. **Caregiver burden:** Reduction in treatment administration burden
5. **Long-term complications:** Potential reduction in arthropathy, other complications

### Managed Entry Agreements
- **UK:** Confidential commercial agreement
- **Other countries:** Likely confidential discounts/risk-sharing arrangements
- **Outcomes-based agreements:** Possible in some jurisdictions
- **Annuitization:** Spreading cost over time under consideration

### Based on Synthesis of All HTA Reports

**Patient Selection:**
1. Careful candidate identification by multidisciplinary team
2. Pre-treatment AAV5 antibody screening mandatory
3. Comprehensive liver assessment including HCC risk factors
4. Shared decision-making with fully informed patients
5. Consideration of age, life expectancy, and treatment goals

**Treatment Delivery:**
1. Administration at specialized hemophilia treatment centers
2. Multidisciplinary team including hematologist and hepatologist
3. Capacity for intensive post-treatment monitoring
4. Participation in data collection/registries

**Monitoring:**
1. Intensive short-term monitoring (liver function, FIX levels)
2. Lifelong HCC surveillance (especially per French guidance)
3. Long-term efficacy monitoring (bleeding rates, FIX activity)
4. Registry participation for real-world evidence generation

**Evidence Generation:**
1. Systematic collection of long-term outcomes data
2. Registry participation to address evidence gaps
3. Monitoring for late-emerging safety signals

## Outstanding Questions and Evidence Gaps

Identified across all HTA assessments:

1. **Long-term durability:** Will FIX expression be sustained >10, >20 years?
2. **HCC causality:** Is the hepatocellular carcinoma case treatment-related?
3. **Late safety signals:** Will other late toxicities emerge?
4. **Treatment failures:** Can we better predict who will not respond?
5. **Comparative effectiveness:** True benefit vs. modern FIX prophylaxis?
6. **Cost-effectiveness:** At what price is Hemgenix cost-effective?
7. **Patient selection:** Can we optimize patient selection criteria?
8. **Quality of life:** What is the true QoL impact over lifetime?
