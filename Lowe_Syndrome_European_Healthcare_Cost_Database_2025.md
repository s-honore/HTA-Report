# Lowe Syndrome Healthcare Cost Database - Western Europe (2023-2025)

**Prepared for:** HTA Model Development
**Geographic Scope:** France, Germany, Netherlands, UK, Belgium
**Perspective:** Healthcare payer (including special education as indirect cost)
**Target Year:** 2025 EUR
**Date Compiled:** January 2025

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document compiles credible Western European healthcare cost estimates for a Lowe syndrome health technology assessment (HTA) model. Data was systematically gathered from published HTAs, DRG systems, fee schedules, peer-reviewed literature, and official government sources. Where 2025 data was unavailable, 2023-2024 estimates were inflated by 2-3% as appropriate.

**Key Limitations:**
- Pediatric-specific costs are limited for many procedures
- Significant variation exists across countries
- Many specialized rare disease costs are not publicly reported
- Some medication costs (especially supplements) lack European pricing data

## ADDITIONAL COST CATEGORIES

### Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Management - Annual Costs

**Context:** Nearly all Lowe syndrome patients have Fanconi syndrome and progressive CKD. Stage varies from 2-5.

| CKD Stage | Annual Cost (EUR) | Source | Country |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| **Stage 3** | €8,030 | 2020 | Germany |
| **Stage 4** | €9,760 | 2020 | Germany |
| **Dialysis (Hemodialysis)** | €39,787 (pediatric) | 2024 | Greece |
| **Dialysis (Peritoneal)** | €56,676 (pediatric) | 2024 | Greece |
| **Dialysis (Online HDF)** | €43,895 (pediatric) | 2024 | Greece |
| **Dialysis (general European)** | >€50,000 (HD), >€30,000 (PD) | 2023-2024 | Western Europe |

**Notes:**
- Greece 2024 pediatric ESRD study is most recent European pediatric-specific data
- Total European CKD costs exceed €140 billion annually
- Pediatric costs likely higher than adult costs due to complexity

**Confidence Level:** HIGH for Greece pediatric data; MEDIUM for general European estimates

| **1st line** | €2,974 | 2023 | Spain |
| **4th+ line** | €5,735 | 2023 | Spain |
| **Drug-refractory (severe)** | €12,925-14,639 | 2020 | Germany |

**Notes:**
- Includes medications, consultations, EEG monitoring, hospitalizations
- ~60-70% of Lowe patients have seizures
- Most respond to 1st or 2nd line AEDs

**Confidence Level:** HIGH

## INFLATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR 2025

For costs reported in 2023-2024, apply:
- **2023 → 2025:** Inflate by 3-4%
- **2024 → 2025:** Inflate by 1.5-2.5%

**European Inflation Context:**
- Healthcare cost inflation typically 2-4% annually
- Germany DRG inflator 2024: 4.22%
- France GHS increase 2024: 4.89-5.19%
- UK NHS cost uplift 2024/25: 5.0%

**Recommended Conservative Approach:** Use 3% annual inflation rate for all 2023 data, 2% for 2024 data

## DATA GAPS AND LIMITATIONS

### High-Priority Gaps:
1. **Pediatric-specific ophthalmology procedure costs** - Most data is for adults
2. **European pharmaceutical pricing** - Especially for kidney supplements (levocarnitine, calcitriol, phosphate)
3. **Special education costs** - No country-specific European data for severe disabilities
4. **DRG-specific costs** - Framework documented but actual EUR amounts require detailed tariff downloads

### Medium-Priority Gaps:
1. **Low vision aids** - European pricing very limited
2. **Eye exam under anesthesia** - No European pricing found
3. **AV fistula creation** - Limited European data
4. **Specific EEG costs** - Market data but not patient procedure costs

### Recommendations for Model Development:
1. **Conservative approach:** Use lower end of ranges for base case
2. **Sensitivity analysis:** Test impact of ±30% variation on all Tier 1 costs
3. **Expert validation:** Consult European pediatric nephrologists and ophthalmologists for cost validation
4. **National databases:** Access France ATIH, Germany InEK, UK NHS tariff workbooks for specific DRG codes
5. **Pharmaceutical databases:** Use European pharmaceutical pricing databases (e.g., WHO/HAI) for medications
