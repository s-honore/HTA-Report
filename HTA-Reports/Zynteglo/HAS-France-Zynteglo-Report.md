## Executive Summary

The French Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ZYNTEGLO (betibeglogene autotemcel) for the treatment of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The assessment found that ZYNTEGLO demonstrated efficacy in achieving transfusion independence and represents a valuable therapeutic alternative for a specific patient population who lack access to matched stem cell donors.

HAS established **specific prescribing conditions** to ensure appropriate use given uncertainties in long-term efficacy and safety, particularly in older patients.

---

## Clinical Evidence Assessment

### Efficacy on Primary Endpoint

**Transfusion Independence:**
- ZYNTEGLO demonstrated efficacy on **transfusion independence**
- Maximum follow-up: **5 years for 3 patients**
- Evidence supports that treated patients can achieve freedom from regular blood transfusions

### Study Population and Design
- Clinical trials enrolled patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia
- Excluded patients with β0/β0 genotype (most severe form)
- Studies evaluated patients who had been previously managed with standard care

### Clinical Benefit Assessment
ZYNTEGLO represents a **therapeutic alternative** to standard life-long symptomatic treatment, which consists of:
- Regular blood transfusions
- Iron chelation therapy to manage transfusion-related iron overload

---

## Patient Population and Eligibility

### Approved Indication
ZYNTEGLO is indicated for patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia (TDT) who:
1. **Do NOT have a β0/β0 genotype**
2. Have an indication for **haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation**
3. **Do NOT have an HLA-matched related HSC donor available**

### Rationale for Restrictions
- HSC transplantation remains the gold standard curative option when a matched related donor is available
- ZYNTEGLO provides an alternative curative approach for patients lacking this option
- The β0/β0 genotype exclusion reflects the clinical trial population and evidence base

---

## HAS Prescribing Conditions

The HAS Transparency Commission established **two cumulative conditions** for ZYNTEGLO prescription to ensure appropriate and safe use:

### 1. Age Restriction

**Eligible Age Range: 12 to 35 years**

**Rationale:**
- ZYNTEGLO has only been assessed in patients **under the age of 35 years** in clinical trials
- **Uncertainties exist** regarding efficacy and safety in older patients
- Lower age limit of 12 years aligns with clinical trial enrollment criteria
- Upper age limit of 35 years reflects the evidence base available

**Clinical Consideration:**
- Younger patients may have longer to benefit from a curative therapy
- Older patients may have accumulated more transfusion-related complications
- Risk-benefit profile may differ in older populations

### 2. Treatment History and Stability Requirement

**Required History:**
- Patients must have been **treated and followed up for at least 2 years** in a specialized center
- Patients must be **clinically stable**

**Rationale:**
- ZYNTEGLO has only been evaluated in patients with established treatment relationships
- Requires optimization of standard treatment before consideration of gene therapy
- Clinical stability ensures patients can safely undergo the intensive treatment process

**Clinical Implications:**
- ZYNTEGLO is **not intended for newly diagnosed patients**
- NOT for patients who are newly starting treatment
- Only for patients who have received **optimal standard treatment** (transfusion + chelation) for at least 2 years
- Treatment must have been provided in a **specialized center** with expertise in thalassemia management

---

## Therapeutic Positioning

### Place in Treatment Pathway

**Standard Treatment Hierarchy:**
1. **First-line curative option**: HLA-matched related donor HSC transplantation
2. **Second-line curative option**: ZYNTEGLO gene therapy (when matched donor unavailable)
3. **Ongoing management**: Lifelong transfusions + iron chelation (when curative options not available)

### Comparison to Alternatives

**vs. Standard Care (Transfusions + Chelation):**
- Offers potential for **cure** vs. lifelong management
- Single treatment vs. ongoing therapy burden
- Eliminates transfusion requirements in successful cases
- Removes iron chelation burden and associated side effects

**vs. Allogeneic HSC Transplant:**
- Available when matched related donor is NOT present
- Uses patient's own modified cells (autologous)
- Avoids graft-versus-host disease risk
- No need for immunosuppression after engraftment

---

## Follow-up and Reassessment

### HAS Monitoring Requirements

**Reassessment Timeline:**
- HAS will **reassess ZYNTEGLO within a maximum period of 3 years**

**Data Sources for Reassessment:**
1. **Registry data** - Real-world use and outcomes in France
2. **All available use data** - Prescribing patterns and patient characteristics
3. **Efficacy data** - Long-term transfusion independence rates
4. **Safety data** - Adverse events and long-term safety signals

### Rationale for Time-Limited Approval
- **Limited long-term data** available at time of initial assessment
- Need to confirm durability of transfusion independence beyond 5 years
- Monitor for late-onset safety signals
- Assess real-world effectiveness vs. clinical trial results
- Evaluate appropriate use according to prescribing conditions

---

## Safety Considerations

### Known Safety Profile
The HAS assessment acknowledged the gene therapy's safety profile based on clinical trials, though specific safety findings were not detailed in available summaries.

### Key Safety Monitoring Areas
1. **Long-term engraftment stability**
2. **Potential for insertional mutagenesis** (theoretical risk with viral vector gene therapies)
3. **Fertility impacts** - Treatment requires myeloablative conditioning
4. **Quality of life outcomes**
5. **Delayed adverse effects**

### Fertility Preservation
- Treatment process involves conditioning regimen that may affect fertility
- Fertility preservation counseling and options should be discussed before treatment
- Important consideration for adolescent and young adult patients

---

## SMR and ASMR Ratings

While specific SMR (Service Médical Rendu / Medical Benefit) and ASMR (Amélioration du Service Médical Rendu / Improvement in Medical Benefit) ratings were not available in the accessible summaries, HAS evaluations typically assign these ratings for reimbursement decisions:

**Expected Considerations:**
- **SMR**: Likely rated as important given the serious nature of TDT and lack of curative alternatives for many patients
- **ASMR**: Potentially significant improvement for the specific population without matched donors

---

## Economic Considerations

### Pricing and Reimbursement
- Specific French pricing information was not available in accessible documents
- European price reported as approximately €1.57 million
- Likely subject to confidential discount agreements
- Reimbursement contingent on meeting HAS prescribing conditions

### Budget Impact
- Small eligible population due to:
  - Rare disease (TDT)
  - Specific genotype exclusion (no β0/β0)
  - Age restrictions (12-35 years)
  - Requirement for matched donor unavailability
  - 2-year stability requirement

---

## Key Strengths of the Evidence

1. **Demonstrated Efficacy**: Clear evidence of transfusion independence achievement
2. **Defined Patient Population**: Clear eligibility criteria based on evidence
3. **Curative Potential**: Offers transformation from chronic disease management to potential cure
4. **Alternative to Transplant**: Provides option when optimal treatment (matched donor transplant) unavailable

---

## Key Limitations and Uncertainties

1. **Limited Long-term Data**: Maximum 5-year follow-up in only 3 patients at time of assessment
2. **Age Restrictions**: No data in patients >35 years old
3. **Durability Questions**: Unknown if transfusion independence persists lifelong
4. **Real-world Effectiveness**: Clinical trial results may not fully reflect real-world outcomes
5. **Genotype Restrictions**: Not suitable for most severe genotype (β0/β0)

---

## Clinical Implementation Considerations

### Specialized Center Requirements
- Treatment must be provided in centers with expertise in:
  - Thalassemia management
  - HSC transplantation procedures
  - Gene therapy administration
  - Apheresis for cell collection
  - Myeloablative conditioning management

### Patient Selection Process
1. Confirm TDT diagnosis and genotype (exclude β0/β0)
2. Verify at least 2 years of optimal standard treatment
3. Confirm clinical stability
4. Verify age 12-35 years
5. Confirm indication for HSC transplant
6. Confirm absence of HLA-matched related donor
7. Discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives
8. Address fertility preservation options

### Treatment Process
1. **Pre-treatment evaluation and preparation**
2. **Cell collection** (apheresis)
3. **Manufacturing period** (cells sent for genetic modification)
4. **Conditioning regimen** (myeloablation)
5. **Infusion** of modified cells
6. **Engraftment monitoring**
7. **Long-term follow-up**
