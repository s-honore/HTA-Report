**URL:** https://www.has-sante.fr/jcms/p_3467529/en/yescarta-axicabtagene-ciloleucel-large-b-cell-lymphomas-including-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-dlbcl-and-primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma-pmlbcl
**Initial Evaluation:** 2018
**Recent Reassessment:** Multiple evaluations conducted

## Executive Summary

The Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) conducted comprehensive evaluations of YESCARTA (axicabtagene ciloleucel) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. HAS issued favorable opinions for reimbursement with specific therapeutic positioning and ongoing monitoring requirements.

**Overall Decision:** FAVORABLE OPINION for reimbursement within defined therapeutic positioning

## 1. Initial Evaluation and Decision (2018)

### Regulatory Milestones:

**August 2018:**
HAS issued Decision n° 2018.0120/DC/SEESP acknowledging the **significant impact of YESCARTA on health insurance expenditure**, triggering a mandatory medico-economic evaluation.

**Initial Recommendation:**
HAS gave a **favorable opinion for reimbursement** in the treatment of adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma that is refractory or relapsed after second-line or later systemic treatment.

### Evaluation by Transparency Commission (Commission de la Transparence):

The Transparency Commission evaluated YESCARTA on multiple dimensions:

#### Clinical Benefit (Service Médical Rendu - SMR):
**Rating: IMPORTANT**

Justification for IMPORTANT clinical benefit:
- **Disease Severity:** DLBCL and PMLBCL are severe diseases with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in relapsed/refractory settings
- **Efficacy:** Demonstrated efficacy in inducing responses, including complete responses with potential for durable remission
- **Safety Profile:** Manageable adverse effects with appropriate patient selection and monitoring at specialized centers
- **Therapeutic Alternative:** Provides treatment option for patients with limited alternatives in third-line+ setting

#### Clinical Added Value (Amélioration du Service Médical Rendu - ASMR):
**Rating: ASMR III (Moderate improvement)**

Justification:
- HAS recognized **maintenance of therapeutic progress** compared to historical management based on various chemotherapies
- Potential for long-term remission with single treatment administration
- Addresses significant unmet medical need in heavily pretreated patient population

### Target Population:

**Approved Indication:**
Adult patients with:
- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, OR
- Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL), OR
- High-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), OR
- DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma (transformed FL)

**After:**
- Two or more lines of systemic therapy
- Relapsed or refractory disease

## 2. Therapeutic Positioning

### Place in Treatment Pathway:

HAS established that **YESCARTA remains a third-line or later treatment** for DLBCL and PMLBCL:

**Patient Selection Criteria:**
1. Adults with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma
2. Failed at least 2 lines of systemic treatments
3. History of autologous transplantation (for patients who were eligible)
   - OR ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant
4. CD19-positive disease
5. Adequate performance status and organ function

**Treatment Sequence:**
- First-line: Standard chemoimmunotherapy (e.g., R-CHOP)
- Second-line: Salvage chemotherapy ± autologous SCT (if eligible)
- Third-line+: **YESCARTA** (or alternative CAR-T therapy, clinical trial, or palliative therapy)

### Comparison with Other CAR-T Therapies:

**YESCARTA vs. KYMRIAH (tisagenlecleucel):**

HAS conducted comparative evaluation and noted:

**Limitations in Comparison:**
- No head-to-head randomized trials
- Differences in trial populations and designs complicate indirect comparisons
- Immaturity of real-world comparative data at time of initial assessment

**Expert Opinion and Early Data:**
According to expert opinions and early follow-up data:

**YESCARTA characteristics:**
- Clinical responses may be **more numerous and faster** than KYMRIAH
- Higher complete response rates observed in some comparisons
- **More frequent acute toxicities**, particularly neurological events
- Shorter time from apheresis to product delivery in some cases

**KYMRIAH characteristics:**
- May have lower rates of severe neurotoxicity in some analyses
- Different manufacturing process and product characteristics

**HAS Conclusion on Comparative Positioning:**
The position of YESCARTA compared to KYMRIAH in the common DLBCL indication **cannot be robustly established** due to:
- Limitations in indirect comparisons
- Immaturity of real-world data
- Differences in patient populations studied
- Need for ongoing evidence generation

**Therapeutic Choice:**
HAS indicates that choice between YESCARTA and KYMRIAH should be based on:
- Individual patient characteristics
- Product availability and manufacturing timeframes
- Physician and center experience
- Risk-benefit assessment for specific patient

## 3. Clinical Evidence Evaluation

### Pivotal Study - ZUMA-1:

**Study Design:**
