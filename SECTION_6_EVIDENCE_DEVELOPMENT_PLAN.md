# SECTION 6: EVIDENCE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

---

## Overview

Successful market access for Lowe syndrome gene therapy requires a comprehensive evidence generation strategy that addresses critical knowledge gaps while supporting regulatory approval and payer acceptance. This section outlines a prioritized, phased approach to building the evidence base necessary for clinical development, regulatory submissions, and health technology assessment (HTA) evaluations.

**Strategic Objectives:**
1. Establish robust natural history data to inform trial design and serve as external control
2. Generate Lowe syndrome-specific quality of life data for economic modeling
3. Design clinical trials optimized for regulatory approval and HTA requirements
4. Build real-world evidence infrastructure for long-term safety and effectiveness monitoring
5. Engage proactively with regulatory and HTA bodies to align evidence requirements

## 6.1 Natural History Study (Immediate Priority)

### 6.1.1 Study Rationale

**Critical Evidence Gaps:**
- Limited published data on eGFR decline trajectories across age cohorts
- Variability in reported progression rates (2.5-5.0 ml/min/1.73m²/year)
- Insufficient characterization of predictive factors for rapid progression
- Lack of standardized measurement protocols across studies

**Strategic Importance:**
- **Regulatory:** FDA and EMA increasingly accept external controls for ultra-rare diseases; robust natural history data enables single-arm trial designs
- **HTA bodies:** NICE, CADTH, and G-BA require validated comparator data for economic modeling
- **Trial design:** Establishes inclusion/exclusion criteria, stratification factors, and sample size calculations
- **Investment:** De-risks clinical development by validating disease model assumptions

### 6.1.2 Study Design

**Study Type:** Retrospective chart review with prospective validation component

**Objectives:**
- **Primary:** Characterize eGFR decline trajectory in Lowe syndrome by age cohort
- **Secondary:**
  - Identify predictive factors for rapid progression
  - Establish time-to-event outcomes (ESKD, dialysis initiation, transplant, death)
  - Document proximal tubulopathy biomarkers alongside eGFR
  - Characterize treatment patterns and healthcare utilization

**Target Population:**
- **Sample size:** 100-200 patients with ≥3 eGFR measurements over ≥2 years

## 6.2 Patient-Reported Outcomes Study

### 6.2.1 Study Rationale

**Current Evidence Gap:**
Existing economic modeling relies on **utility mapping** from chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations, which does not capture:
- Intellectual disability impact (90% of Lowe syndrome patients)
- Visual impairment from cataracts and glaucoma
- Neurological comorbidities (seizures, behavioral disorders)
- Developmental delay and educational challenges
- Caregiver burden specific to multi-system disorder

**Strategic Need:**

- **Broader value framework:** Captures elements beyond standard QALY calculation
- **Publication opportunity:** First comprehensive QoL assessment in Lowe syndrome

### 6.2.2 Study Design

**Study Type:** Cross-sectional quality of life survey with prospective longitudinal component

**Objectives:**
- **Primary:** Establish Lowe syndrome-specific utility weights by CKD stage
- **Secondary:**
  - Quantify caregiver burden
  - Identify key quality of life drivers
  - Assess preference for treatment attributes (one-time vs. chronic, efficacy vs. safety)
  - Characterize disease-specific concerns and priorities

**Target Population:**
- **Sample size:** 50-100 patient-caregiver dyads
- **Age distribution:**
  - Pediatric (2-12 years): 60% (proxy-reported by caregivers)

---

### 6.3.2 Phase 2/3 Pivotal Trial: Registration-Enabling Study

#### Study Design Overview

**Study Type:** Pivotal efficacy and safety study (design options detailed below)

**Primary Objective:** Demonstrate efficacy of AAV-OCRL gene therapy on eGFR slope vs. natural history control in Lowe syndrome patients

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Confirm safety in larger cohort
- Evaluate time to CKD stage progression
- Assess quality of life and neurodevelopmental outcomes
- Characterize long-term durability through Year 5
- Support label claims for proximal tubulopathy improvement

#### Study Population

**Sample Size:** 30-50 patients (see design options below)

**Key Inclusion Criteria:**
- Age 2-20 years (broader than Phase 1/2 to support pediatric label)
- Genetically confirmed OCRL mutation
- eGFR 30-90 ml/min/1.73m² (CKD stages 2-3)
- eGFR decline documented over prior 6-12 months (evidence of progression)
- Parent/guardian consent, patient assent

**Stratification Factors:**
- Age (<10 years vs. ≥10 years)
  - **Rationale:** Younger patients may have greater treatment benefit
- Baseline eGFR (<60 vs. ≥60 ml/min/1.73m²)
  - **Rationale:** Disease severity impacts progression rate

#### Design Option 1: Randomized Delayed-Start Design (Preferred)

**Rationale:** Ethical for rare disease; enables randomized comparison while ensuring all patients receive treatment

**Design:**
- **Arm 1 (Early Start, n=20-25):** Gene therapy at Month 0
- **Arm 2 (Delayed Start, n=20-25):** Gene therapy at Month 12
- **Primary analysis timepoint:** Month 12 (comparison of eGFR slopes)
- **Long-term follow-up:** All patients followed through Year 5

**Advantages:**
- Randomized controlled design strengthens causal inference
- All patients ultimately receive therapy (addresses ethical concerns)
- Internal control group during first 12 months
- Enables assessment of "catch-up" effect after delayed treatment

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires family acceptance of 12-month delay
- Higher screen failure rate due to patient/family preference

**Primary Endpoint:**
- **Month 0-12 eGFR slope:** Early Start arm vs. Delayed Start arm
- **Analysis:** ANCOVA adjusting for baseline eGFR and age
- **Hypothesis:** Early Start arm has slower eGFR decline (more positive slope)

#### Design Option 2: Single-Arm with External Control (Alternative)

**Rationale:** Maximizes enrollment; acceptable to FDA for ultra-rare diseases with robust natural history data

**Design:**
- **Treatment arm (n=30-40):** All patients receive gene therapy at Month 0
- **External control:** Natural history cohort from Section 6.1 study, propensity-score matched
- **Primary analysis timepoint:** Month 24

**Advantages:**
- No randomization barrier to enrollment
- Faster recruitment
- Leverages natural history study investment
- Precedent: Zolgensma, Luxturna approved with external controls

**Disadvantages:**
- Potential for unmeasured confounding
- Requires robust matching methodology
- HTA bodies may apply discount to effectiveness estimates

**Primary Endpoint:**
- **Month 0-24 eGFR slope:** Treatment arm vs. matched external control
- **Analysis:** Difference-in-differences, adjusting for propensity score
- **Matching variables:** Age, baseline eGFR, OCRL mutation type, concomitant medications

#### Design Option 3: Adaptive Design with Interim Re-Assessment

**Rationale:** Optimize sample size based on emerging efficacy data; balance rigor with feasibility

**Design:**
- **Stage 1 (n=20):** Initial enrollment, interim analysis at 12 months
- **Stage 2 (n=10-30):** Additional enrollment if interim shows promise but not definitive
- **Stopping rules:**
  - **Early success:** Stop for efficacy if overwhelming benefit (p<0.005)
  - **Futility:** Stop if no trend toward benefit (p>0.50)
  - **Continue:** Enroll Stage 2 if 0.005<p<0.50

**Advantages:**
- Efficient use of resources
- Avoids over-enrollment if highly effective
- Avoids under-enrollment if modest but meaningful effect
- FDA increasingly receptive to adaptive designs for rare diseases

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex statistical considerations (alpha spending, conditional power)
- Requires pre-specified decision rules
- Interim analysis timing must balance information gain vs. enrollment momentum

#### Primary Endpoint: eGFR Slope Over 24 Months

**Definition:** Annualized rate of change in eGFR from Month 0 to Month 24

**Rationale:**
- **Regulatory precedent:** FDA and EMA accept eGFR slope as surrogate endpoint for CKD drug approvals (SGLT2 inhibitors, finerenone, etc.)
- **Reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit:** eGFR decline strongly correlates with ESKD onset, cardiovascular events, and mortality
- **Quantitative & objective:** Reduces subjectivity in rare disease trials
- **Feasible timeline:** 24 months sufficient to detect meaningful slowing vs. 4 ml/min/1.73m²/year natural decline

**Measurement:**
- **eGFR calculation:**
  - Schwartz equation (pediatric, <18 years): eGFR = k × Height(cm) / Serum Cr(mg/dL), where k=0.413
  - CKD-EPI equation (adults, ≥18 years)
- **Measurement frequency:** Every 3 months (9 total measurements over 24 months)
- **Central laboratory:** Single lab for creatinine assays to minimize inter-assay variability
- **Slope calculation:** Linear mixed-effects model with random intercept and slope per patient

**Success Criterion:**
- **Target:** ≥40% reduction in eGFR decline rate vs. natural history
- **Example:** Natural history slope = -4.0 ml/min/1.73m²/year
  - Treatment slope target: ≥-2.4 ml/min/1.73m²/year
  - Absolute difference: ≥1.6 ml/min/1.73m²/year
- **Statistical significance:** Two-sided α=0.05, power=80-90%

#### Secondary Endpoints

### 6.3.3 Regulatory Endpoint Rationale: eGFR Slope as Surrogate

#### Regulatory Precedent

**FDA Acceptance of eGFR Decline as Surrogate:**

The FDA has accepted eGFR slope as a surrogate endpoint "reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit" for several CKD drug approvals:

**Approved Therapies Using eGFR Endpoint:**
- **Dapagliflozin (Farxiga):** SGLT2 inhibitor for CKD, approved 2021 based on eGFR slope + albuminuria reduction
- **Finerenone (Kerendia):** Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, approved 2021 based on composite endpoint including eGFR decline
- **Empagliflozin (Jardiance):** SGLT2 inhibitor, CKD indication approved 2023

**FDA Guidance:**
- **"Chronic Kidney Disease: Developing Drugs for Treatment" (2022):** Explicitly endorses eGFR slope as acceptable endpoint for accelerated or full approval, depending on effect size and durability

**Key Criteria for Acceptance:**
1. **Validation:** eGFR decline strongly predicts ESKD onset, cardiovascular events, and mortality in large epidemiologic studies
2. **Reproducibility:** Standardized creatinine assays enable precise eGFR calculation
3. **Clinical meaningfulness:** Slowing eGFR decline by 40-50% associated with meaningful delay in ESKD
4. **Feasible measurement:** Can be assessed over 18-24 months (vs. decades for ESKD as primary endpoint)

#### Application to Lowe Syndrome

**Why eGFR Slope is Ideal Primary Endpoint:**

**1. Objective & Quantitative**
- Serum creatinine measured by standardized enzymatic assay
- eGFR calculated via validated equations (Schwartz pediatric, CKD-EPI adult)
- Minimal inter-observer variability

**2. Directly Related to Pathophysiology**
- Lowe syndrome causes progressive loss of nephrons and glomerular filtration capacity
- eGFR quantifies cumulative kidney function
- Proximal tubule dysfunction (earlier manifestation) may not correlate perfectly with eGFR, but eGFR decline determines prognosis

**3. Predicts Clinical Outcomes**
- Natural history studies show eGFR decline rate predicts time to ESKD
- Median ESKD age 32 years with current decline rate (~4 ml/min/1.73m²/year)
- Halving decline rate would delay ESKD by 15-20 years

**4. Feasible in Rare Disease Trial**
- 24-month observation sufficient to detect 40-50% slowing
- No need for decades-long trial to observe ESKD events
- External natural history control enables smaller sample size

**5. Alignment with Treatment Mechanism**
- Gene therapy restores OCRL enzyme in proximal tubule epithelial cells
- Prevents further tubule damage and nephron loss
- eGFR slope directly measures rate of nephron loss

#### Regulatory Positioning

**FDA Submission Strategy:**

**Accelerated Approval Pathway:**
- **Basis:** eGFR slope as surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit (ESKD delay, survival)
- **Commitment:** Post-approval confirmatory study (15-year registry) to verify clinical benefit
- **Precedent:** Similar to SGLT2 inhibitor approvals

**Label Language (Proposed):**
- **Indication:** "Treatment of Lowe syndrome to slow the decline in kidney function"
- **Efficacy statement:** "[Drug name] reduced the rate of eGFR decline by [X]% compared to natural history over 24 months"
- **Clinical benefit:** "Slowing eGFR decline is expected to delay onset of end-stage kidney disease"

**EMA Submission Strategy:**

**Conditional Approval:**
- **Basis:** Positive benefit-risk for serious, life-threatening condition with unmet need
- **Condition:** Complete long-term follow-up study (5-year data) to confirm durability
- **Annual re-assessment:** Provide updated registry data demonstrating sustained benefit

**PMDA (Japan) Strategy:**
- **Sakigake designation:** Innovative gene therapy for rare pediatric disease
- **Conditional approval:** Similar to EMA

#### Success Criteria: What Effect Size is Sufficient?

**Regulatory Perspective:**

**FDA Guidance on Clinical Meaningfulness:**
- **40% reduction in eGFR decline rate** is generally considered clinically meaningful
- Example: Natural history -4.0 ml/min/1.73m²/year → Treatment -2.4 ml/min/1.73m²/year
- **Rationale:** Delays ESKD by 10-15 years, transforming prognosis

**Modeling Exercise:**
- **Baseline:** eGFR 70 ml/min/1.73m² at age 5, declining at 4.0 ml/min/1.73m²/year
  - Time to ESKD (eGFR <15): 13.75 years → ESKD at age 18.75
- **40% slowing:** Declining at 2.4 ml/min/1.73m²/year
  - Time to ESKD: 22.9 years → ESKD at age 27.9 (gain of 9.2 years)
- **70% slowing:** Declining at 1.2 ml/min/1.73m²/year
  - Time to ESKD: 45.8 years → ESKD at age 50.8 (gain of 32 years)
- **Stabilization:** No decline
  - Never reaches ESKD (if maintained lifelong)

**Regulatory Thresholds:**
- **Minimum for approval:** ≥40% slowing (9-10 year ESKD delay)
- **Strong approval case:** ≥60% slowing (20+ year delay)
- **Transformative benefit:** Near-complete stabilization (prevents ESKD)

**Statistical Significance Required:**
- Two-sided p<0.05 for primary endpoint
- Effect size clinically meaningful (not just statistically significant)
- Consistent direction across sensitivity analyses and subgroups

#### HTA Body Expectations

**NICE (UK):**
- Accepts surrogate endpoints for HST if "validated" and "reasonably likely" to predict clinical benefit
- Expects sensitivity analysis exploring range of long-term clinical benefit assumptions
- Discounts surrogate-based evidence compared to direct clinical outcome evidence (~10-20% discount to effectiveness)

**CADTH (Canada):**
- Requires "reasonable certainty" that surrogate endpoint translates to clinical benefit
- Expects economic model to link eGFR slope to ESKD, survival, QoL (modeled relationship)
- May apply "uncertainty" in economic model (higher discount rate, lower effectiveness estimate)

**ICER (USA):**
- Accepts eGFR slope for CKD drugs (precedent set by SGLT2 inhibitors)
- Expects long-term extrapolation model linking slope to outcomes
- Values broader impact (QoL, caregiver burden) beyond ESKD delay

**G-BA (Germany):**
- Assesses "added therapeutic benefit" vs. appropriate comparator
- Surrogate endpoints acceptable if validated
- For Lowe syndrome, comparator is "best supportive care" (no active therapy)
- eGFR improvement = "considerable added benefit" (Category 3)

### Mitigation Strategy Detail

#### Critical Evidence Gaps (HIGH Risk)

**1. eGFR Natural History Data**

**Current Gap:**
- Published literature reports variable eGFR decline rates (2.5-5.0 ml/min/1.73m²/year)
- Limited longitudinal data with standardized eGFR measurements
- Uncertainty about age-specific decline patterns

**Impact:**
- Cannot design trial sample size without precise decline rate estimates
- Regulators require robust natural history comparator for single-arm or external control trials
- Economic model baseline assumptions lack validation

**Mitigation:**
- **Study:** Retrospective chart review (Section 6.1)
- **Timeline:** Complete before Phase 2/3 trial initiation (12-18 months)
- **Deliverables:** Published natural history paper, regulatory briefing document, economic model input

**Success Criteria:**
- 100+ patients with ≥3 eGFR measurements over ≥2 years
- Mean annual decline rate estimated with <0.5 ml/min/1.73m²/year precision (95% CI)
- Age-stratified estimates (pediatric vs. adolescent vs. adult)

---

**2. Long-Term Durability (>5 Years)**

**Current Gap:**
- Gene therapy durability unknown beyond 2-5 years in most therapies
- AAV episomal DNA may be lost during cell division (proximal tubule cells have turnover)
- Immune responses may emerge years post-treatment

**Impact:**
- HTA bodies discount benefits if durability unproven
- Economic model must assume waning efficacy or plateau, affecting cost-effectiveness
- Payers resistant to full upfront payment without durability assurance

**Mitigation:**
- **Registry:** 15-year longitudinal follow-up (Section 6.4.1)
- **Interim analyses:** 3-year, 5-year, 10-year data releases
- **Biomarkers:** Vector biodistribution, OCRL enzyme activity tracked annually
- **Re-dosing plan:** If efficacy wanes, provide protocol for re-treatment (pricing TBD)

**Success Criteria:**
- eGFR slope remains stable (no return to natural history decline rate) through Year 5
- ≥70% of patients maintain ≥50% slowing of decline at Year 5
- No new safety signals emerge in long-term follow-up

---

#### Moderate Evidence Gaps (MEDIUM Risk)

**3. Lowe-Specific Utility Weights**

**Current Gap:**
- Economic model uses utilities mapped from CKD populations
- Lowe syndrome has additional comorbidities (intellectual disability, visual impairment) not captured in CKD utilities
- NICE and CADTH may challenge validity of mapped utilities

**Impact:**
- Uncertainty in QALY estimates affects ICER
- Sensitivity analysis required, widening confidence intervals
- HTA bodies may discount QALY gains if mapping not validated

**Mitigation:**
- **Study:** Prospective QoL survey (Section 6.2)
- **Timeline:** Complete before HTA submissions (6-12 months)
- **Deliverables:** Lowe-specific EQ-5D utilities by CKD stage, published paper

**Success Criteria:**
- 50-100 patient-caregiver dyads enrolled
- EQ-5D utilities stratified by CKD stage (2, 3a, 3b, 4, 5)
- Comparison to mapped utilities shows <0.10 difference (validation) or identifies where adjustments needed

---

**4. Optimal Treatment Age**

**Current Gap:**
- Unknown whether younger patients (ages 2-5) benefit more than older patients (ages 15-20)
- Earlier treatment may prevent irreversible nephron loss, but younger children have anesthesia/infusion challenges
- Older patients have more advanced disease, limiting treatment response potential

**Impact:**
- Regulatory label may restrict age range
- Payers may limit reimbursement to optimal age window
- Economic model must model age-specific cost-effectiveness

**Mitigation:**
- **Trial design:** Age stratification in Phase 2/3 (<10 years vs. ≥10 years)
- **Subgroup analysis:** Interaction test for age × treatment effect
- **Registry:** Long-term comparative effectiveness by age at treatment

**Success Criteria:**
- Identify age cutoff (if any) where treatment effect diminishes
- Support label language: "Treatment is recommended in patients ages X-Y"
- Inform payer reimbursement criteria

---

**5. Pediatric Safety (<5 Years Old)**

**Current Gap:**
- Phase 1/2 trial enrolls ages 5-16; younger children excluded
- Younger children have immature immune systems, different AAV biodistribution
- Regulatory may require additional pediatric data before full approval

**Impact:**
- Regulatory label may exclude ages <5 without additional data
- Pediatric population ages <5 represents 15-20% of eligible patients

**Mitigation:**
- **Phase 2/3 trial:** Include patients ages 2-5 (if Phase 1/2 safety acceptable)
- **Pediatric monitoring plan:** Enhanced safety monitoring for ages <5 cohort
- **Registry:** Long-term safety data in young children treated commercially

**Success Criteria:**
- No increased safety signal in ages 2-5 vs. ages 5-16
- Regulatory approval for ages ≥2 years (or ≥5 years with future pediatric label expansion)

---

#### Low Priority Evidence Gaps (LOW Risk)

**6. Neurodevelopmental Impact**

**Current Gap:**
- Unknown whether earlier kidney disease treatment indirectly benefits neurodevelopment (improved metabolic milieu, reduced hospitalizations)
- OCRL gene also expressed in brain, but AAV unlikely to cross blood-brain barrier

**Impact:**
- Exploratory endpoint; not required for approval
- Positive neurodevelopmental signal adds value for HTA and patient families
- Absence of benefit does not undermine approval case

**Mitigation:**
- **Trial:** Include neurodevelopmental assessments (Bayley, Wechsler) as exploratory endpoints
- **Registry:** Long-term developmental tracking
- **Messaging:** "Neurodevelopmental benefit not expected but monitored"

---

**7. Caregiver Burden**

**Current Gap:**
- Quantitative data on caregiver burden lacking for Lowe syndrome
- Broader value frameworks (ICER, NICE) increasingly value caregiver impact

**Impact:**
- Societal perspective cost-effectiveness analysis requires caregiver productivity data
- Not required for approval, but strengthens value proposition

**Mitigation:**
- **QoL Study:** Include PedsQL Family Impact Module (Section 6.2)
- **Registry:** Track caregiver QoL longitudinally
- **Economic model:** Sensitivity analysis including caregiver productivity gains

---
