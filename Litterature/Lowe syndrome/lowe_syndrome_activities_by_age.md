## Executive Summary

This document maps healthcare activities (surgeries, check-ups, hospitalizations, therapies, etc.) for Lowe syndrome across different age ranges to support lifetime cost modeling. Activities are categorized by organ system and life stage.

**Key Cost Drivers Identified**:
1. **Ophthalmological interventions** (birth to 20 years, ongoing monitoring lifelong)
2. **Kidney management** (progressive from infancy, potentially leading to ESRD and transplant)
3. **Neurological care** (seizure management, developmental support)
4. **Developmental therapies** (intensive in early years, ongoing support)
5. **Orthopedic interventions** (rickets management, fracture care)

## KEY GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HTA MODEL

### Data Limitations in This Source
1. **No specific cost data** - resource utilization only
2. **Limited transplant data** - only 2 cases reported
3. **No specific dialysis duration data**
4. **Survey from 2008** - may not reflect current practice patterns
5. **Age distribution of death** not fully detailed (range 19 months to 56 years reported)

### Additional Data Sources Needed
1. **Registry data** for current survival and ESRD rates
2. **Claims data** for actual healthcare costs
3. **Updated natural history** studies (post-2010)
4. **Dialysis survival data** specific to Lowe syndrome
5. **Transplant outcomes** in Lowe syndrome
6. **Detailed hospitalization patterns**

### Model Structure Recommendations
1. **Create distinct health states** based on:
   - CKD stage (1-5)
   - Dialysis vs transplant status
   - Seizure presence/control
   - Vision impairment severity
2. **Incorporate age-specific resource use** as mapped above
3. **Model transitions** between CKD stages (key driver)
4. **Account for quality of life** differences by health state
5. **Consider both direct medical and indirect costs** (caregiver time, special education, etc.)
