**Clinical Report:** https://www.cadth.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/car-t/ct0002-clinical-report-redacted.pdf

## Executive Summary

The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) has issued a conditional positive reimbursement recommendation for axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) for the treatment of adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) that is refractory to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or that relapses within 12 months of first-line chemoimmunotherapy, who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).

**Recommendation:** REIMBURSE WITH CONDITIONS

## 1. Reimbursement Recommendation

CADTH recommends that Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) **should be reimbursed** by public drug plans for the treatment of adult patients with DLBCL or HGBL **only if** the following conditions are met:

### Eligibility Criteria:
1. **Disease Characteristics:**
   - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) OR
   - High-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL)
   - That is refractory to first-line chemoimmunotherapy OR relapses within 12 months of first-line chemoimmunotherapy

2. **Patient Criteria:**
   - Adults who are eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)
   - Have not yet been treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy
   - Are in relatively good health (adequate performance status)

3. **Pricing Condition:**
   - **A price reduction is required** - the cost of Yescarta must be reduced to represent good value to the healthcare system

## 2. Clinical Evidence

### Rationale for Recommendation

**Clinical Evidence Base:**
The CADTH recommendation is primarily based on:
- **ZUMA-7 trial**: A randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 3 study comparing axicabtagene ciloleucel with standard of care (SOC) in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL or HGBL within 12 months of first-line therapy

### ZUMA-7 Study Design:
- **Population:** Adults with early relapsing aggressive B-cell NHL
- **Intervention:** Axicabtagene ciloleucel (single infusion)
- **Comparator:** Standard of care (2-3 cycles of salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT in responders)
- **Primary Endpoint:** Event-free survival (EFS)
- **Secondary Endpoints:** Overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), complete response (CR), patient-reported outcomes

### Key Clinical Findings:

**Efficacy Outcomes:**
- **Event-Free Survival (EFS):** Statistically significant improvement with axicabtagene ciloleucel compared to SOC
  - Median EFS: 8.3 months (axi-cel) vs 2.0 months (SOC)
  - HR = 0.398 (95% CI: 0.308 to 0.514); p < 0.0001

- **Overall Survival (OS):** Trend toward improvement but not statistically significant at the time of analysis
  - Median OS: Not reached (axi-cel) vs 12.4 months (SOC) at primary analysis
  - High rate of crossover from SOC arm confounded OS analysis

- **Response Rates:**
  - Overall Response Rate: 83% (axi-cel) vs 50% (SOC)
  - Complete Response Rate: 65% (axi-cel) vs 32% (SOC)

**Safety Profile:**
Common and serious adverse events include:
- Cytokine release syndrome (CRS): 93% any grade, 6% grade ≥3
- Neurological events: 78% any grade, 25% grade ≥3
- Grade ≥3 adverse events: 90% (axi-cel) vs 83% (SOC)
- Infections
- Prolonged cytopenias

### Clinical Expert Input:
- Clinical experts on the CADTH review panel emphasized the significant unmet need in this population
- Early relapsing patients have particularly poor prognosis with conventional therapy
- Axicabtagene ciloleucel offers potential for durable remission in a one-time treatment

### Patient Input:
Patient advocacy groups highlighted:
- Devastating impact of early relapse
- Desire for treatments that offer long-term disease control
- Importance of quality of life during and after treatment
- Concerns about access and wait times

## 3. Economic Evaluation

### Sponsor's Economic Model:
The sponsor (Kite/Gilead) submitted a cost-utility analysis comparing axicabtagene ciloleucel with standard of care (salvage chemotherapy followed by ASCT).

**Model Structure:**
- Partitioned survival model
- Health states: Pre-treatment, event-free, progressed disease, post-ASCT, death
- Lifetime horizon (40 years)
- Canadian public healthcare payer perspective

### Costs:

**Treatment Costs:**
- **Axicabtagene ciloleucel:** $485,021 per patient (one-time cost)
  - Includes: product cost, apheresis, bridging therapy, lymphodepletion, infusion, monitoring

- **Standard of Care:** Variable costs
  - Salvage chemotherapy
  - High-dose chemotherapy and ASCT (for responders)
  - Supportive care
  - Disease management

**Additional Healthcare Costs:**
- Adverse event management (CRS, neurotoxicity, infections)
- Long-term follow-up
- Disease monitoring
- Subsequent therapies for progression

### CADTH Reanalysis:

**Key Issues Identified by CADTH:**
1. **Uncertainty in long-term survival projections:** Extrapolation beyond trial data introduces uncertainty
2. **OS benefit unclear:** Crossover in ZUMA-7 complicates interpretation of OS benefit
3. **Cost of subsequent therapies:** Uncertainty about treatment costs after progression
4. **Utility values:** Questions about quality of life assumptions
5. **Generalizability:** Trial population may not reflect all eligible patients

**CADTH's Base Case Results:**
After reanalysis addressing methodological concerns:
- **Incremental Cost:** Substantially higher for axicabtagene ciloleucel
- **Incremental QALYs:** Gain in quality-adjusted life years
- **ICER:** The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio exceeded CADTH's willingness-to-pay threshold

**Economic Conclusion:**
Based on CADTH's assessment of the health economic evidence, **Yescarta does not represent good value to the healthcare system at the public list price**. A price reduction is therefore required to achieve cost-effectiveness.

### Price Reduction Required:
CADTH's economic analysis indicates that a **substantial price reduction** (specific percentage confidential) would be needed for axicabtagene ciloleucel to be considered cost-effective at commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds in Canada.

## 4. Implementation Considerations

### Adoption Feasibility:
1. **Infrastructure Requirements:**
   - Accredited CAR-T treatment centers
   - Apheresis capabilities
   - ICU-level monitoring facilities
   - Trained healthcare professionals in CAR-T management

2. **Patient Flow Considerations:**
   - Timely referral processes
   - Patient assessment and selection
   - Manufacturing time (typically 3-4 weeks)
   - Bridging therapy during manufacturing
   - Post-infusion monitoring (minimum 7-10 days inpatient)

3. **Geographic Access:**
   - Limited number of authorized centers (concentrated in major urban areas)
   - Travel and accommodation considerations for rural/remote patients
   - Caregiver requirements

### Budget Impact:
- Estimated eligible patient population in Canada
- Anticipated uptake rate
- One-time high cost per patient but potential for durable benefit
- Offset by reduced costs of subsequent therapies and hospitalizations (if treatment successful)
- Detailed budget impact analysis conducted (specific numbers confidential)

## 5. Comparison with Other Jurisdictions

### International HTA Decisions:
- **NICE (UK):** Positive recommendation with patient access scheme
- **HAS (France):** Positive with outcomes-based arrangements
- **IQWIG (Germany):** Orphan drug designation, added benefit acknowledged
- **PBAC/MSAC (Australia):** Funded through specialized therapies program

Canada's conditional recommendation aligns with international assessments emphasizing clinical benefit but requiring price considerations.
