## Executive Summary

NICE has issued evidence-based recommendations on onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma) for treating spinal muscular atrophy in babies. The guidance covers both symptomatic and presymptomatic treatment scenarios through two highly specialised technologies guidance documents (HST15 and HST24).

Zolgensma is available on the NHS as a possible treatment for 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene, subject to specific clinical criteria and restrictions.

## 1. Recommendations

### HST15 - Symptomatic SMA Type 1

Onasemnogene abeparvovec is recommended for treating spinal muscular atrophy in babies with:
- 5q spinal muscular atrophy with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene
- Clinical diagnosis of type 1 SMA
- Specific clinical and age-related restrictions apply

**Conditions:**
- The drug is available with a simple discount patient access scheme
- Treatment must be provided within the NHS framework
- Specific eligibility criteria must be met regarding disease stage and patient characteristics

### HST24 - Presymptomatic SMA

Evidence-based recommendations on onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma) for treating presymptomatic spinal muscular atrophy in babies aged 12 months and under. This guidance partially updates NICE highly specialised technologies guidance HST15.

**Key Eligibility Criteria:**
- Babies aged 12 months and under
- Presymptomatic status confirmed
- Genetic confirmation of 5q SMA with bi-allelic mutation in SMN1 gene
- Specific SMN2 gene copy number criteria

---

## 2. The Condition - Spinal Muscular Atrophy

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by:
- Progressive muscle weakness and atrophy
- Caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene
- Results in loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord
- Classification into different types based on age of onset and severity

**SMA Type 1:**
- Most severe form
- Onset before 6 months of age
- Inability to sit unsupported
- Significant respiratory complications
- Historically poor prognosis without treatment

---

## 3. The Technology

**Drug Name:** Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma)
**Manufacturer:** Novartis Gene Therapies
**Technology Type:** Gene therapy
**Marketing Authorization:** Authorized for use in the UK

### Mechanism of Action

Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a gene therapy that:
- Delivers a functional copy of the SMN1 gene
- Uses an adeno-associated virus (AAV9) vector
- Provides one-time intravenous infusion treatment
- Aims to address the genetic root cause of SMA

### Administration

- Single intravenous infusion
- Dose: 1.1 × 10^14 vector genomes (vg)/kg body weight
- One-time treatment
- Requires specialized treatment centers and monitoring

---

## 4. Clinical Evidence

The NICE evaluation considered multiple clinical studies including:
- Pivotal clinical trials
- Ongoing observational studies
- Real-world evidence from UK treatment centers
- Long-term follow-up data

### Key Efficacy Outcomes Evaluated:
- Event-free survival (absence of death or permanent ventilation)
- Motor milestone achievement (sitting, standing, walking)
- Respiratory support requirements
- Feeding support requirements
- Overall survival

### Safety Profile:
- Comprehensive safety monitoring required
- Potential adverse events include hepatotoxicity
- Need for pre-treatment screening and post-treatment monitoring
- Risk management strategies in place

---

## 5. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

### Economic Model

NICE's evaluation included:
- Cost-utility analysis using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)
- Comparison with nusinersen (Spinraza) and best supportive care
- Lifetime horizon model
- NHS and Personal Social Services perspective

### Key Economic Considerations:

**Treatment Costs:**
- High upfront cost for one-time treatment
- Simple discount patient access scheme in place
- Confidential discount agreed with NHS England

**Cost-Effectiveness Results:**
- Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) evaluated
- Assessed against NICE's highly specialised technologies criteria
- Consideration of ultra-rare disease status
- Significant clinical benefit recognized

### Uncertainties:
- Long-term efficacy data still emerging
- Limited head-to-head comparative data
- Durability of treatment effect over lifetime
- Natural history data limitations

---

## 6. Committee Discussion

The Highly Specialised Technologies Evaluation Committee considered:

### Clinical Effectiveness:
- Substantial clinical benefit demonstrated
- Significant improvements in survival and motor function
- One-time treatment offers potential advantages
- Early intervention critical for optimal outcomes

### Patient and Clinical Expert Input:
- Transformative impact on patients and families
- Addresses significant unmet medical need
- Importance of access to innovative treatments
- Early diagnosis and treatment crucial

### Innovation:
- First gene therapy for SMA
- Novel mechanism addressing genetic cause
- Potential for disease modification
- Represents significant innovation in rare disease treatment

### Equality Considerations:
- Importance of equitable access
- Consideration of genetic testing and early diagnosis
- Treatment timing critical for effectiveness

---

## 7. Implementation and Access

### Patient Access Scheme:
- Simple discount patient access scheme agreed
- Confidential discount with NHS England
- Ensures cost-effective access within NHS

### Treatment Centers:
- Specialized centers authorized to provide treatment
- Requirements for appropriate facilities and expertise
- Comprehensive monitoring protocols required

### Eligibility Assessment:
- Multidisciplinary team assessment required
- Genetic confirmation mandatory
- Clinical staging assessment
- Age and weight considerations

---

## 8. Monitoring and Review

### Post-Market Surveillance:
- Ongoing safety monitoring required
- Long-term efficacy data collection
- Registry participation recommended
- Regular reporting to regulatory authorities

### Future Review:
- NICE may update guidance as new evidence emerges
- Monitoring of real-world outcomes
- Assessment of long-term durability
