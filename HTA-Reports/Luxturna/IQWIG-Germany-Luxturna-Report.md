## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

IQWiG conducted an assessment of voretigene neparvovec for the treatment of patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy caused by biallelic RPE65 gene mutations. Under Germany's orphan drug regulations, this assessment followed a special expedited process where the added medical benefit is deemed proven by regulatory approval, and IQWiG's role was limited to evaluating patient numbers and costs rather than conducting a full benefit assessment.

---

## GERMAN ORPHAN DRUG FRAMEWORK

### Legal Basis: §35a Paragraph 1, Sentence 11 SGB V

Under German law, orphan drugs receive special consideration in the benefit assessment process:

**Key Principles:**
1. **Automatic Proof of Benefit:** The added medical benefit of orphan drugs is deemed as proven by the fact that they have been approved (EMA authorization)
2. **Limited Assessment Scope:** IQWiG only evaluates:
   - Patient numbers eligible for treatment
   - Costs to the healthcare system
3. **No Comparative Benefit Assessment:** Unlike standard new drugs, IQWiG does not assess clinical evidence or comparative effectiveness for orphan drugs below the revenue threshold
4. **Revenue Threshold:** This expedited process applies to orphan drugs with annual sales below €50 million in Germany

### Rationale for Special Process
- Recognition of challenges in generating robust evidence for ultra-rare diseases
- Small patient populations make large randomized trials difficult
- Incentive structure to encourage development of treatments for rare diseases
- Alignment with European regulatory framework for orphan designations

---

## INDICATION

**Approved Indication:**
Voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna) is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy (erbliche Netzhautdystrophie) caused by confirmed biallelic RPE65 gene mutations and who have sufficient viable retinal cells.

**ICD-10 Codes:**
- H35.5: Hereditary retinal dystrophy

---

## ASSESSMENT SCOPE

### IQWiG Commission (April 9, 2019)
The Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned IQWiG to assess:

1. **Patient Number Estimation:**
   - Epidemiology of RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophy in Germany
   - Eligible patient population for treatment
   - Incident and prevalent cases
   - Annual treatment demand

2. **Cost Assessment:**
   - Drug acquisition costs
   - Administration and procedure costs
   - Healthcare system resource utilization
   - Budget impact to statutory health insurance (GKV)

### What IQWiG Did NOT Assess
Under the orphan drug framework:
- ❌ Clinical benefit assessment (deemed proven by EMA approval)
- ❌ Comparative effectiveness analysis
- ❌ Quality of evidence evaluation
- ❌ Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios

---

## PATIENT POPULATION ASSESSMENT

### Epidemiology of RPE65-Mediated IRD

**Disease Prevalence:**
- RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophy is an ultra-rare genetic condition
- Part of the spectrum of retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis
- Estimated prevalence in Germany: approximately 1-2 per 100,000 population

### Eligible Patient Numbers in Germany

**Key Considerations:**
1. **Genetic Confirmation Required:** Only patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations
2. **Viable Retinal Cells:** Patients must have sufficient remaining retinal tissue
3. **Disease Stage:** Both early and later stages may be eligible if viable cells remain

**Estimated Eligible Population:**
- The manufacturer's dossier provided estimates of eligible patients in Germany
- IQWiG reviewed the methodology and assumptions used
- Final patient number estimates incorporated into G-BA decision-making
- Exact numbers considered confidential business information

### Annual Treatment Demand
- One-time treatment per patient (bilateral, both eyes)
- Prevalent cases: existing eligible patients at time of approval
- Incident cases: newly diagnosed eligible patients per year
- Treatment demand expected to decrease after prevalent cases are treated

---

## COST ASSESSMENT

### Drug Acquisition Costs

**List Price in Germany:**
- Voretigene neparvovec list price: €613,410 per patient (for both eyes)

## G-BA DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

### Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) Role

Following IQWiG's assessment, the G-BA:
1. **Reviews IQWiG Report:** Patient numbers and cost assessment
2. **Conducts Hearing Process:** Stakeholder input from:
   - Medical societies
   - Patient organizations
   - Manufacturer
   - Payers (health insurance funds)
3. **Determines Extent of Benefit:** While added benefit is deemed proven for orphan drugs, G-BA determines the **extent** (magnitude) of added benefit
4. **Issues Resolution:** Final decision on benefit classification and subsequent price negotiations

### Benefit Categories in Germany

The G-BA classifies added benefit into categories:
- **Major added benefit** (erheblicher Zusatznutzen)
- **Considerable added benefit** (beträchtlicher Zusatznutzen)
- **Minor added benefit** (geringer Zusatznutzen)
- **Non-quantifiable added benefit** (nicht quantifizierbarer Zusatznutzen)
- **No added benefit proven** (Zusatznutzen nicht belegt)

For orphan drugs, benefit is deemed proven, but extent is categorized.

### Price Negotiations

Following G-BA decision:
- Reimbursement price negotiated between manufacturer and GKV-Spitzenverband
- Negotiated price considers:
  - Extent of added benefit determination
  - European reference pricing
  - Budget impact
  - Orphan drug status
