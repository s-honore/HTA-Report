## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) conducted a health technology assessment of voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna) for the treatment of biallelic RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophies. MSAC provides advice to the Australian Government Minister for Health about the strength of evidence for new medical services and technologies and whether they should be publicly funded through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS).

### Key Determination
MSAC supported public funding for voretigene neparvovec with conditions, acknowledging the clinical need for an effective treatment in this rare, severely debilitating condition, while noting limitations in the evidence base and cost-effectiveness analysis.

## AUSTRALIAN HTA CONTEXT

### MSAC vs. PBAC

**Important Distinction:**
- **MSAC (Medical Services Advisory Committee):** Assesses new medical services, procedures, and technologies including gene therapies
- **PBAC (Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee):** Typically assesses conventional pharmaceuticals for the PBS

**Why MSAC for Luxturna:**
Voretigene neparvovec was assessed by MSAC rather than PBAC because:
- It is a gene therapy requiring specialized surgical delivery
- Assessment includes both the drug product and the procedure
- Involves evaluation of a medical service (subretinal gene therapy administration)
- Complex one-time intervention rather than chronic pharmaceutical therapy

### TGA Approval Status
- **TGA Approval Date:** December 15, 2020
- **Sponsor:** Novartis Pharmaceuticals Australia Pty Ltd
- **Status:** First gene therapy approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)
- **Orphan Drug Designation:** Granted for this rare disease indication

---

## INDICATION

**Proposed Indication:**
Treatment of patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy caused by confirmed biallelic RPE65 gene mutations and who have sufficient viable retinal cells.

**Target Population:**
- Adult and pediatric patients
- Confirmed genetic diagnosis of biallelic RPE65 mutations
- Inherited retinal dystrophies including:
  - Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA)
  - Retinitis pigmentosa (RP)
- Adequate remaining viable retinal tissue

---

## MSAC RECOMMENDATION

### Recommendation Status: **SUPPORTED (with conditions)**

MSAC supported public funding for voretigene neparvovec, acknowledging:
- ✓ The clinical need for an effective treatment for this rare, severely debilitating condition
- ⚠ Limitations in the evidence base
- ⚠ Concerns about the cost-effectiveness analysis
- ✓ Recognition of broader societal benefits not captured in traditional health economic models

### Key Conditions and Caveats

**1. Review Requirement:**
MSAC required a **full review within three years** of approval to:
- Assess real-world effectiveness
- Evaluate long-term durability of treatment effect
- Review actual patient numbers and budget impact
- Consider updated cost-effectiveness evidence

**2. Cost-Effectiveness Concerns:**
MSAC noted that the cost-effectiveness analysis:
- Did not adequately capture benefits for carers and families
- Had uncertainty in long-term durability assumptions
- Required conservative interpretation

**3. Implementation Requirements:**
- Treatment must be delivered at specialized centers
- Appropriate patient selection processes required
- Genetic confirmation mandatory
- Experienced surgical teams necessary

---

## CLINICAL EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT

### Evidence Base Reviewed

**Primary Clinical Studies:**
1. **Study 301 (Phase 3):**
   - Randomized, controlled, open-label trial
   - Intervention group received voretigene neparvovec
   - Control group received no intervention initially (then crossed over)
   - Primary endpoint: Multi-luminance mobility testing (MLMT)

2. **Study 101 (Phase 1/2):**
   - Single-arm, long-term follow-up study
   - Provided data on durability of effect
   - Safety assessment over extended period

### Clinical Outcomes Assessed

#### Primary Efficacy Outcome: Multi-Luminance Mobility Testing (MLMT)
**MSAC Findings:**
- Statistically significant improvement in MLMT scores in treated patients
- MLMT measures functional mobility at various light levels
- Improvements represent meaningful functional benefit
- Sustained benefit observed in follow-up data

**Clinical Interpretation:**
- MLMT is a functional outcome measuring real-world mobility
- Changes translate to improved ability to navigate in low light conditions
- Represents clinically meaningful benefit for patients
- Novel outcome measure with some validation challenges

#### Secondary Efficacy Outcomes

**Visual Acuity:**
- Variable changes across patients
- Some improvements observed, but high inter-individual variability
- Many patients showed stabilization rather than improvement
- Visual acuity alone may not capture full benefit

**Visual Field:**
- Improvements in Goldmann visual field testing
- Prevention of progressive field loss
- Variable response across patients
- Challenges in measurement reliability acknowledged

**Full-field Light Sensitivity Threshold (FST):**
- Improvements in light sensitivity
- Correlation with other vision measures
- Objective assessment of retinal function

### Safety Assessment

**MSAC Safety Review:**
- Acceptable safety profile for a severe, progressive condition
- Adverse events primarily procedure-related
- Manageable with standard clinical care

**Common Adverse Events:**
- **Ocular:** Conjunctival hyperemia, cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, retinal abnormalities
- **Procedural:** Related to subretinal injection and vitreoretinal surgery
- **Systemic:** Limited systemic adverse events

**Long-term Safety:**
- Limited long-term safety data at time of assessment
- Need for ongoing surveillance
- Post-market monitoring required

- Uncertainty in QALY estimation
- Challenges in capturing full benefit

**4. Budget Impact:**
- High per-patient cost
- Small eligible population (rare disease)
- Uncertainty in actual patient numbers
- One-time cost vs. ongoing benefits

### ICER Considerations

While specific ICER values may be commercial-in-confidence:
- MSAC noted concerns about cost-effectiveness
- Traditional thresholds may not adequately capture value
- Orphan disease and unmet need considerations
- Broader value elements not quantified
