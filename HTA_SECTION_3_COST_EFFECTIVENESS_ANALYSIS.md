# Section 3: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

# 3.1 Summary

This section presents the results of a comprehensive health economic evaluation of gene therapy for Lowe syndrome, conducted from a Danish healthcare perspective. The analysis aims to determine the maximum justifiable reimbursement price for this intervention based on established cost-effectiveness thresholds and epidemiological considerations.

## Objective and Scope

The primary objective of this analysis is to establish the maximum justifiable reimbursement price for gene therapy in Lowe syndrome by evaluating the intervention's cost-effectiveness relative to standard care. The evaluation employs a validated disease progression model to project health outcomes and healthcare costs over the patient lifetime (assumed 60-year time horizon from treatment initiation).

## Key Economic Findings

The analysis yields several critical findings regarding the value proposition for gene therapy in Lowe syndrome:

**Reimbursement Value**: Applying a willingness-to-pay threshold of DKK 1.12 million (approx. EUR 150,000) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, the maximum justifiable reimbursement price is estimated at DKK 10.7 million (approx. EUR 1,440,144) per treatment course. This valuation reflects the health benefits attributable to early intervention in this serious genetic condition.

**Clinical Effectiveness**: The base case analysis demonstrates an incremental gain of 7.72 QALYs per treated patient (11.06 undiscounted life years), with an associated incremental life expectancy gain of 17.45 years. These benefits reflect both the extended survival and improved quality of life achieved through early intervention.

**Cost-Effectiveness**: The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) derived from probabilistic sensitivity analysis is DKK 992,392 (approx. EUR 133,207) per QALY gained, with a 95 percent confidence interval of DKK 498,079 to DKK 1,539,842 (approx. EUR 66,843 to EUR 206,690). The probability that gene therapy meets the DKK 1.12 million (approx. EUR 150,000) per QALY cost-effectiveness threshold is 70.7 percent, indicating favorable value at the established reimbursement threshold.

**Treatment Timing**: Stratified analysis by age at treatment initiation reveals that earlier intervention (age 1 to 5 years) yields 15 to 20 percent greater health gains compared with delayed treatment (age 10 to 15 years). This finding has important implications for optimal treatment sequencing and reimbursement policy.

## Limitations

The analysis is subject to several key uncertainties, including long-term treatment durability assumptions, extrapolation of survival and quality of life outcomes beyond the clinical trial period, and limited real-world evidence on adverse event rates. These limitations are addressed through comprehensive sensitivity analyses presented in subsequent sections.
