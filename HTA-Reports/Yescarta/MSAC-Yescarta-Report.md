**Assessment Number:** MSAC Application 1722.1
**Country:** Australia
**Agency:** Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC)
**URL:** http://www.msac.gov.au/internet/msac/publishing.nsf/Content/1722.1-public
**Alternative URL:** https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/msac/publishing.nsf/Content/1722.1-public

## Executive Summary

The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) assessed axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. In Australia, CAR-T cell therapy is managed as a **technology rather than a 'medicine'**, so funding is sought through MSAC rather than the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC).

**Funding Decision:** APPROVED for public funding through the Highly Specialised Therapies Program

## 1. Regulatory and Funding Context in Australia

### Why MSAC Rather Than PBAC?

**Technology Classification:**
CAR-T cell therapies are classified as **medical technologies** rather than traditional pharmaceutical medicines because:
- Manufactured from patient's own cells (autologous product)
- Complex manufacturing and administration process
- Involves medical procedures (leukapheresis, infusion)
- Requires specialized healthcare infrastructure

**Funding Pathway:**
- **PBAC (Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee):** Traditional medicines listed on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)
- **MSAC (Medical Services Advisory Committee):** Medical technologies and procedures
- CAR-T therapies → **MSAC pathway**

### Highly Specialised Therapies Program:

**Program Description:**
The Highly Specialised Therapies (HST) Program funds new, very expensive treatments through the National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA).

**Eligibility Criteria:**
- Cost **$200,000 or more per patient**
- Use at specific public hospitals
- Approved by MSAC
- Funded jointly by Commonwealth and state/territory governments

**Governance:**
- MSAC recommends inclusion in HST Program
- Joint Commonwealth-State funding arrangement
- Implementation through designated public hospitals
- Monitoring and evaluation requirements

## 6. Comparator

### Standard of Care:

**Comparator for MSAC Assessment:**
Standard salvage chemotherapy regimens for relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma after 2+ lines of therapy.

**Options Include:**
- GDP (gemcitabine, dexamethasone, cisplatin)
- ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide)
- DHAP (dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin)
- GemOx (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin)
- Other salvage regimens
- Best supportive care
- Clinical trial participation

**Outcomes with Standard Care:**
- Limited efficacy in heavily pretreated population
- Low response rates in third-line+ setting
- Short duration of response
- Poor overall survival (typically 6-8 months)
- Significant toxicity with repeated chemotherapy

**Autologous SCT:**
- Not typically feasible in third-line+ setting
- Most eligible patients already received ASCT in second-line
