**Pricing:**
- List price: £282,000 per infusion
- Commercial arrangement provides a discount to the NHS (confidential)

#### TA975 (May 2024) - Updated Appraisal
**Status:** Current guidance (replaced TA554)
**Official URL:** https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta975
**Publication Date:** 15 May 2024

**Indication:** Treating relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in people 25 years and under

**Key Updates:**
- Replaced TA554 which was available through the Cancer Drugs Fund
- Updated based on longer-term follow-up data from ongoing trials
- Incorporated real-world evidence from NHS usage

### 2. Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)

#### TA567 (March 2019)
**Status:** Active
**Official URL:** https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta567
**Publication Date:** 13 March 2019
**Documents:** https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta567/history

**Indication:** Treating relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after 2 or more systemic therapies

**Assessment Process:**
- NICE initially rejected Kymriah for DLBCL due to concerns over limited clinical evidence
- Evidence concerns included:
  - Single-arm study design
  - Small observational study sample size
- Eventually approved following commercial arrangement

**Reimbursement Approach:**
- Approved using Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) scheme
- Future price and reimbursement reassessment based on:
  - Longer-term follow-up from ongoing trials
  - Real-world data collection

#### TA933 (Terminated Appraisal)
**Status:** Terminated
**Official URL:** https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta933
**PDF:** https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta933/resources/tisagenlecleucel-for-treating-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-bcell-lymphoma-after-2-or-more-systemic-therapies-terminated-appraisal-pdf-82615606390213

**Reason for Termination:**
- Novartis did not provide a complete evidence submission
- Appraisal was terminated without a recommendation

## Executive Summary

### Clinical Evidence Review
NICE evaluated tisagenlecleucel across two main indications:

1. **B-cell ALL (pediatric/young adult):**
   - Strong clinical evidence from pivotal trials
   - Rapid approval process demonstrated confidence in evidence
   - Long-term follow-up data supported continued recommendation

2. **Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (adult):**
   - Initial concerns about evidence quality
   - Single-arm trial design raised uncertainty
   - Conditional approval through Cancer Drugs Fund allowed evidence generation

### Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

**Key Considerations:**
- High upfront cost (£282,000 per infusion) offset by potential curative benefit
- One-time treatment vs. ongoing chemotherapy costs
- Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from durable remissions
- End-of-life considerations applied
- Commercial discount arrangements (confidential) essential for approval

**NICE's Approach:**
- Applied flexible ICER thresholds for end-of-life treatments
- Considered innovation and step-change in treatment paradigm
- Utilized Cancer Drugs Fund for evidence development
- Required real-world data collection for conditional approvals

### Committee Discussion Points

**Positive Factors:**
- Potential for curative outcomes in heavily pre-treated patients
- Unmet medical need in relapsed/refractory populations
- Innovation in CAR-T therapy technology
- Step-change from existing treatment options

**Concerns:**
- Uncertainty in long-term survival extrapolation
- Limited comparative evidence (single-arm trials)
- High cost and budget impact
- Infrastructure requirements for CAR-T administration

### Final Recommendations

**B-cell ALL (TA975 - Current):**
- **RECOMMENDED** for NHS use
- For people 25 years and under with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL
- With commercial arrangement (confidential discount)

**DLBCL (TA567 - Current):**
- **RECOMMENDED** for NHS use
- For relapsed or refractory DLBCL after 2 or more systemic therapies
- Through Coverage with Evidence Development scheme
- With commercial arrangement (confidential discount)

## Conclusions

NICE demonstrated pragmatic flexibility in assessing Kymriah:
1. **Fast-track approval** for ALL indication showed confidence in evidence
2. **Coverage with Evidence Development** for DLBCL balanced access with uncertainty
3. **Commercial arrangements** were critical to achieving cost-effectiveness
4. **Real-world evidence** requirements ensure ongoing value assessment

The dual-track approach (standard approval for ALL, conditional for DLBCL) reflects NICE's evidence-based methodology while acknowledging innovation in CAR-T therapy.
