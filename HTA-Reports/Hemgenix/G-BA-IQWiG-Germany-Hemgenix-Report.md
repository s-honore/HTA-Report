## Executive Summary

The German Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, G-BA) conducted a benefit assessment (Nutzenbewertung) of etranacogen dezaparvovec (Hemgenix) for the treatment of hemophilia B. Given the expected lack of comparative data, the G-BA initiated a process for accompanying data collection (anwendungsbegleitende Datenerhebung, AbD). The final resolution was issued on October 19, 2023.

## Product Information

**Generic Name (INN):** Etranacogen dezaparvovec
**Brand Name:** Hemgenix
**ATC Code:** B02BD (Blood coagulation factors)
**Pharmaceutical Form:** Gene therapy vector suspension for intravenous infusion
**Indication:** Hemophilia B (Hämophilie B)

## German HTA Process Overview

### Orphan Drug Designation

Hemgenix is designated as an orphan drug for hemophilia B, which affects the benefit assessment process:
- Additional benefit is automatically considered granted upon approval
- G-BA assesses appropriateness of the target population and cost estimation
- Less extensive comparative benefit assessment than non-orphan drugs

### Early Benefit Assessment (§ 35a SGB V)

The benefit assessment was conducted according to:
- § 35a Social Code Book V (SGB V)
- Early benefit assessment for newly approved pharmaceuticals
- Specific considerations for orphan drugs

---

## G-BA Resolution (Beschluss vom 19. Oktober 2023)

### Key Components of Decision

The G-BA issued a comprehensive resolution addressing:
1. Recognition of therapeutic indication
2. Assessment of patient population
3. Therapy costs evaluation
4. Requirements for accompanying data collection (AbD)
5. Restrictions on prescribing authorization

### Decision Outcome

The G-BA concluded the benefit assessment and issued requirements for:
- Post-authorization data collection
- Limitations on which healthcare providers can prescribe
- Monitoring and reporting obligations

---

## Accompanying Data Collection (Anwendungsbegleitende Datenerhebung)

### Rationale for AbD

**G-BA Assessment (August 2022):**

The G-BA anticipated that:
- **No comparative data would be available** for etranacogen dezaparvovec versus existing therapies
- Additional real-world evidence would be necessary
- Data collection should begin at the time of market entry

This proactive approach reflects concerns about:
- Long-term efficacy and durability
- Safety in broader patient population
- Treatment failures and predictors of response
- Comparative effectiveness versus standard of care

### AbD Process Timeline

1. **August 2022:** G-BA initiates deliberations on requiring AbD
2. **G-BA commissioned IQWiG** to develop a concept for accompanying data collection
3. **Deadline:** January 13, 2023, for IQWiG concept development
4. **May 12, 2023:** G-BA issues requirement for AbD (Decision 2022-AbD-005)
5. **October 19, 2023:** Final resolution with AbD requirements and prescribing restrictions

### AbD Requirements

The pharmaceutical company is required to:
- Conduct systematic data collection on all treated patients
- Submit study protocol and statistical analysis plan for review
- Collect data on efficacy, safety, and patient outcomes
- Report data periodically to G-BA
- Address specific research questions identified by G-BA/IQWiG

### Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan Review

**G-BA Decision on Protocol Review (Decision 6726):**

The G-BA reviewed and approved:
- Study protocol for the accompanying data collection
- Statistical analysis plan
- Data collection forms and procedures
- Timeline for data submission

**Start of AbD:** Following protocol approval
