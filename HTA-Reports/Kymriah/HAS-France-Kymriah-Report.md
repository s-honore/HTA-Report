## HAS Assessment Framework

### Two-Part Evaluation System

**1. Transparency Commission (CT - Commission de la Transparence):**
Evaluates clinical value and therapeutic positioning

**2. Committee of Economic Evaluation and Public Health (CEESP):**
Conducts economic evaluation (introduced for CAR-T therapies from 2019)

---

## Clinical Assessment by Transparency Commission

### SMR Rating (Service Médical Rendu - Medical Benefit)

**Definition:** Overall therapeutic value considering:
- Efficacy and safety
- Disease severity
- Therapeutic alternatives
- Public health impact

**Possible Ratings (from highest to lowest):**
- Important (Important)
- Moderate (Modéré)
- Weak (Faible)
- Insufficient (Insuffisant)

**Tisagenlecleucel SMR Ratings:**

**B-cell ALL:** **IMPORTANT CLINICAL BENEFIT**
- High unmet need in relapsed/refractory pediatric/young adult population
- Limited alternative treatment options
- Life-threatening condition
- Potential for durable remissions

**DLBCL:** **IMPORTANT CLINICAL BENEFIT**
- Significant unmet need in heavily pre-treated population
- Poor prognosis with conventional salvage therapies
- Curative potential in responding patients

**Follicular Lymphoma:** Clinical benefit rating available on HAS website

---

### ASMR Rating (Amélioration du Service Médical Rendu - Improvement in Medical Benefit)

**Definition:** Improvement compared to existing treatments

**Rating Scale:**
- **ASMR I:** Major improvement (major innovation)
- **ASMR II:** Important improvement
- **ASMR III:** Moderate improvement
- **ASMR IV:** Minor improvement
- **ASMR V:** No improvement
- **ASMR VI:** Negative (less effective than comparator)

**Tisagenlecleucel ASMR Ratings:**

Specific ASMR ratings determined by HAS based on:
- Comparative clinical evidence
- Magnitude of benefit vs. standard treatments
- Innovation in mechanism of action
- Therapeutic gap addressed

**Note:** While HAS issued favorable opinions recognizing "important clinical benefit," the indication recommended for reimbursement was **restricted in some cases** due to lack of clinical data in excluded subpopulations.

## Economic Evaluation by CEESP

### First Economic Evaluations of CAR-T in France (2019)

**Background:**
CAR-T cell therapies were first subject to economic evaluation by CEESP starting in 2019, representing a new frontier for HTA in France.

### Economic Assessment Challenges

**CEESP Conclusion on Cost-Effectiveness:**
The Committee of Economic Evaluation and Public Health (CEESP) **invalidated the estimated incremental cost-utility ratios** of tisagenlecleucel.

**Reasons for Invalidation:**

1. **Insufficient Clinical Evidence:**
   - Single-arm trial designs
   - Limited comparative data
   - Short follow-up periods at initial assessment
   - Uncertainty in patient selection effects

2. **Methodological Quality Concerns:**
   - Inadequate long-term disease progression extrapolation
   - Uncertainty in survival curve modeling
   - Questionable utility value assumptions
   - Limited real-world evidence at time of assessment

3. **Economic Conclusion:**
   Tisagenlecleucel was **not proven cost-effective** based on the economic evaluation.

## Reassessment Process

### Ongoing Evidence Generation

**HAS Concerns During Reassessment:**
HAS expressed concerns during reassessment regarding the **lack of additional data requested from the first assessment**.

**Implications:**
- Some uncertainties in clinical evidence persist
- Additional real-world evidence needed
- Long-term outcome data collection continues

**Reassessment Outcome:**
Despite ongoing concerns about evidence gaps, these concerns **did not affect the reassessment** favorably. The important clinical benefit rating was maintained.

## Reimbursement Decision and Pricing

### Favorable Reimbursement Opinions

**Overall Outcome:**
HAS issued **favorable opinions for reimbursement** across multiple indications, recognizing the important clinical benefit for patients with limited alternatives.

**Reimbursement Conditions:**
1. Restricted to patients matching clinical trial populations
2. Use in qualified CAR-T centers only
3. Registry participation for real-world evidence collection
4. Appropriate patient selection criteria followed

### Pricing Negotiations

**CEPS Involvement:**
Economic Committee for Health Products (Comité Économique des Produits de Santé - CEPS) negotiates price with manufacturer following HAS opinion.

**Pricing Considerations:**
- ASMR rating influences price negotiations
- International price comparisons (European reference pricing)
- Budget impact on French healthcare system
- Managed entry agreements potential

**Outcome:**
Specific pricing is confidential but negotiated at the national level for reimbursement by l'Assurance Maladie (French social security health insurance).

## Managed Entry Agreements

### Outcomes-Based Reimbursement

**French Approach to CAR-T Therapies:**
France, along with other major European countries, has implemented **outcomes-based reimbursement** schemes for gene therapies including CAR-T.

**Key Features:**

1. **Performance-Linked Pricing:**
   - Payment contingent on patient outcomes
   - Refunds or discounts if outcomes not achieved
   - Focus on response rates and durability

2. **Risk-Sharing Mechanisms:**
   - Financial risk shared between payer and manufacturer
   - Protects healthcare system from non-responders
   - Incentivizes manufacturer to ensure quality

3. **Real-World Evidence Collection:**
   - Mandatory registry participation
   - Outcome tracking for all treated patients
   - Data informs future pricing and reimbursement decisions

**Implementation Challenges:**
- Administrative complexity
- Outcome definition and measurement
- Timeline for assessment
- Data collection burden

- Neurological toxicities monitored closely
- Range from mild confusion to severe encephalopathy
- Reversible in most cases with appropriate management

**Long-Term Toxicities:**
- B-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia
- Requires immunoglobulin replacement
- Infection risk management
- Secondary malignancy surveillance

**HAS Conclusion on Safety:**
Safety profile considered acceptable given severity of diseases treated and limited alternatives, provided treatment occurs in qualified centers with appropriate monitoring.

## Patient Access and Equity

### Healthcare System Integration

**Universal Coverage:**
Tisagenlecleucel covered by l'Assurance Maladie (French social security health insurance) for approved indications.

**Patient Pathway:**
1. Diagnosis and treatment failure at local center
2. Referral to qualified CAR-T center
3. Multidisciplinary team assessment of eligibility
4. Leukapheresis and manufacturing
5. Bridging therapy if needed (covered separately)
6. Admission for conditioning and CAR-T infusion
7. Post-treatment monitoring and follow-up

**Geographic Access:**
- CAR-T centers in major metropolitan areas
- Regional coordination for patient referrals
- Transportation and accommodation support for patients/families
- Telemedicine for some follow-up visits

**Equity Considerations:**
- Universal coverage reduces financial barriers
- Geographic disparities remain (urban vs. rural)
- Language and health literacy support needs
- Socioeconomic factors in treatment tolerance
