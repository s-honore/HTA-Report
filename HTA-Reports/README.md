## Report Contents

Each gene therapy directory contains:

1. **Agency-specific reports** with detailed assessments including:
   - Executive summaries
   - Clinical evidence evaluation
   - Cost-effectiveness analysis
   - Safety assessment
   - Committee recommendations
   - Implementation requirements
   - Official URLs for source documents

2. **Summary/Index document** providing:
   - Comparative overview of all agency decisions

## Key Findings Across All Gene Therapies

### Clinical Evidence
- Most approvals based on single-arm studies or limited RCT data
- High unmet medical need recognized universally
- Small patient populations (orphan drug status)
- Long-term durability data limited at time of initial assessment

### Economic Challenges
- Ultra-high costs ($400K - $4.7M per patient)
- Cost-effectiveness thresholds exceeded in most jurisdictions
- Confidential commercial agreements/discounts required
- Outcomes-based payment arrangements common

### Implementation Requirements
- Treatment at specialized centers only
- Multidisciplinary team involvement
- Intensive monitoring protocols
- Registry participation for real-world evidence
- Managed access/coverage with evidence development

### Safety Profiles
- Generally acceptable given disease severity
- Serious adverse events managed with protocols
- Long-term safety monitoring required
- Specialized toxicity management (e.g., CRS for CAR-T)
