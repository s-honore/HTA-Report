- **Assessment Status**: DISCONTINUED
- **Date Discontinued**: August 2021

## Executive Summary

The NICE appraisal of betibeglogene autotemcel for treating transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia (ID968) was **suspended from NICE's work programme in August 2021** and subsequently **discontinued** as no further information was received from the company.

In **February 2024**, NICE published **negative draft guidance** rejecting Zynteglo for regular NHS use, citing significant concerns about the limited evidence base.

---

## Clinical Evidence Assessment

### Evidence Base
- **Study Design**: Clinical trials were described as **small** with limited sample sizes
- **Follow-up Duration**: Participants had not been followed up for **very long periods**
- **Key Limitation**: Data came from a small sample of patients, raising concerns about the robustness of conclusions

### Clinical Efficacy Findings
Despite the limitations, NICE noted that clinical trials suggest:
- Certain TDT patients treated with Zynteglo may **no longer require blood transfusion**
- Some patients may require transfusions **less frequently** than before treatment
- The one-off gene therapy has potential to provide a curative treatment option

### Patient Population
- **Target Population**: People with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT)
- **Current Standard Care**: Life-long blood transfusions combined with iron chelation therapy
- **Unmet Need**: Life-threatening condition with curtailed life expectancy and significant treatment burden

---

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

### Price and Discount
- **European Price**: Approximately **€1.57 million** (~£1.4 million)
- **Discount**: bluebird bio agreed to supply at a **confidential discount** from the list price
- **US Price**: $2.8 million (for reference)

### NICE's Economic Concerns

1. **Discount Rate**
   - NICE applied its **standard discount rate of 3.5%** to calculate long-term benefits
   - This may have disadvantaged a one-time treatment with long-term benefits

2. **Additional Cost Considerations**
   - Costs of **fertility preservation** procedures
   - Technical modeling issues including the number of simulated profiles in bluebird's data

3. **Long-term Uncertainty**
   - Limited long-term follow-up data to support lifetime benefit projections
   - Uncertainty about durability of treatment effect over decades

### Value Assessment Issues
- Small patient numbers in trials made statistical projections less reliable
- Limited real-world evidence available at time of assessment
- Difficulty in modeling lifetime benefits from short-term trial data

---

## NICE Decision and Recommendations

### Initial Draft Guidance (2020-2021)
- Raised a series of technical and economic issues with the submission
- Insufficient evidence to support cost-effectiveness at proposed price
- Process suspended in August 2021 due to lack of company response

### 2024 Draft Guidance
- **Recommendation**: **NOT RECOMMENDED** for routine NHS use
- NICE **rejected** the beta-thalassaemia gene therapy for regular NHS use

### Key Issues Identified
1. Small sample sizes in clinical trials
2. Short follow-up periods
3. Uncertainty about long-term efficacy and safety
4. Cost-effectiveness not demonstrated at proposed pricing
5. Technical modeling concerns
6. Insufficient data on fertility preservation impacts and costs

---

## Company Response

### bluebird bio's Position
- The company expressed being **"baffled"** by NICE's rejection
- Noted that the dossier presented to NICE was compiled in **2019**
- Company now has **six years' worth of follow-up data** (as of 2024)
- Highlighted this was the **first time NICE had assessed a gene therapy** using its single technology assessment process

### Process Concerns
- Company suggested NICE's standard processes may not be well-suited to assessing gene therapies
- One-time curative treatments pose unique challenges for traditional HTA frameworks
- Discounting methodology may disadvantage therapies with upfront costs but lifetime benefits

---

## Current Status (2025)

### Regulatory Status
- **EMA Approval**: Granted May 2019, **withdrawn March 2022** at company's request (commercial reasons)
- **FDA Approval**: Approved August 2022 for US market
- **UK Status**: Not available on NHS; assessment discontinued

### Market Withdrawal Context
The European marketing authorization was withdrawn in March 2022, which occurred **before** the 2024 NICE draft guidance. This withdrawal was for **commercial reasons** rather than safety or efficacy concerns, reflecting the challenges bluebird bio faced with pricing negotiations and reimbursement decisions across European markets.

---

## Assessment Methodology

### NICE Process Used
- **Single Technology Appraisal (STA)** process
- First gene therapy assessed through this pathway
- Standard cost-effectiveness framework applied
- Evidence Review Group (ERG) conducted independent assessment

### Assessment Challenges for Gene Therapies
1. Limited patient populations (typical for rare diseases)
2. Short-term trial data for lifetime benefit projections
3. One-time cost vs. ongoing savings modeling
4. Novel mechanism of action with limited precedent
5. Appropriate discount rate for upfront vs. long-term costs

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Assessment Discontinued**: The original NICE appraisal (ID968) was discontinued in 2021 due to lack of company engagement

2. **Subsequent Negative Recommendation**: A 2024 draft guidance recommended against NHS use, citing insufficient evidence

3. **Evidence Gaps**: Small trials with short follow-up were key concerns limiting NICE's confidence in the evidence base

4. **Cost-Effectiveness Not Demonstrated**: At the proposed price point, even with confidential discounts, NICE could not conclude the therapy represented value for money

5. **Novel Assessment Challenges**: This case highlighted the challenges of applying traditional HTA frameworks to one-time curative gene therapies

6. **Market Context**: The European market withdrawal in 2022 preceded the 2024 NICE guidance, reflecting broader commercialization challenges for ultra-high-cost gene therapies
