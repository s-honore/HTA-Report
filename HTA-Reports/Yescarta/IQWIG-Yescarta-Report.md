## Executive Summary

The Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) conducted a benefit assessment of axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy, according to §35a (paragraph 1, sentence 11) of the German Social Code Book V (SGB V).

**Assessment Type:** Orphan Drug Assessment (Expiry of Decision)

## 1. Regulatory and Assessment Context

### German HTA Framework:

Under the German AMNOG (Arzneimittelmarktneuordnungsgesetz) process:
1. **Free Pricing Period:** New drugs can be priced freely for the first 12 months after launch
2. **Early Benefit Assessment:** HTA conducted by G-BA with support from IQWiG during the first year
3. **Price Negotiation:** Following assessment, price negotiation occurs with GKV Spitzenverband (National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds)

### Orphan Drug Special Status:

As an **orphan medicinal product**, axicabtagene ciloleucel receives special consideration under §35a SGB V:
- **Added medical benefit is deemed proven** by the fact of marketing authorization approval
- IQWiG assessment focuses on:
  - Information on patient numbers
  - Costs and therapeutic costs per patient per year
  - Requirements for quality-assured application

This means the clinical benefit assessment is simplified compared to non-orphan drugs.

## 2. Technology Description

### Product Information:
- **International Non-proprietary Name (INN):** Axicabtagene ciloleucel
- **Trade Name:** YESCARTA®
- **Manufacturer:** Kite Pharma EU B.V. (Gilead Sciences)
- **ATC Code:** L01XX70 (Other antineoplastic agents)

### Mechanism of Action:
Axicabtagene ciloleucel is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy.

**Manufacturing Process:**
1. Patient's T cells collected via leukapheresis
2. Genetic modification using retroviral vector to express anti-CD19 CAR
3. Ex vivo expansion
4. Cryopreservation and transport to treatment center
5. Patient receives lymphodepleting chemotherapy
6. Infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel

### Approved Indication (EMA):
Treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy.

Includes:
- DLBCL not otherwise specified
- Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma
- High-grade B-cell lymphoma
- DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma

## 3. Patient Numbers Assessment

### Target Population in Germany:

IQWiG evaluated the pharmaceutical company's submission on the number of patients in the statutory health insurance (GKV) system eligible for treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel.

**Estimation Methodology:**
The patient number calculation considered:
- Incidence of DLBCL and PMLBCL in Germany
- Proportion with relapsed or refractory disease after first-line therapy
- Proportion receiving second-line therapy
- Proportion failing second-line therapy and eligible for third-line treatment
- Proportion meeting eligibility criteria for CAR-T therapy
- Market share assumptions

**Eligible Patient Population:**
The assessment evaluated the company's estimates for the annual number of GKV-insured patients eligible for axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment (specific numbers are part of the confidential assessment report).

### Considerations:
- Age distribution of patients with aggressive lymphoma
- Performance status and fitness for CAR-T therapy
- Proportion with CD19-positive disease
- Availability of adequate T-cell collection
- Geographic access to certified CAR-T centers in Germany

## 4. Cost Assessment

The assessment evaluated whether the company's cost calculations were complete, transparent, and methodologically appropriate.

## 5. Benefit Assessment

### Orphan Drug Status - Added Benefit Deemed Proven:

According to §35a (1) sentence 11 SGB V, for orphan drugs:
- **The added medical benefit is deemed proven by the marketing authorization**
- The extent of added benefit is classified based on the marketing authorization and available evidence

### Evidence Base:

Although a full comparative benefit assessment was not required due to orphan status, the assessment considered available evidence:

**Pivotal Study - ZUMA-1:**
- Phase 1/2, single-arm, multicenter study
- 111 patients with refractory aggressive NHL enrolled
- Primary endpoint: Objective response rate (ORR)
- Key secondary endpoints: Duration of response, overall survival, progression-free survival

**Key Efficacy Results from ZUMA-1:**
- ORR: 82% (95% CI: 73%-90%)
- Complete response (CR): 54% (95% CI: 44%-64%)
- Median duration of response: 11.1 months (CR: not reached)
- Median overall survival: Not reached at primary analysis
- 18-month overall survival: 52%

**Safety Profile:**
- Grade ≥3 adverse events: 95%
- Cytokine release syndrome (CRS): 93% (any grade), 13% (grade ≥3)
- Neurological events: 64% (any grade), 28% (grade ≥3)
- Infections: Common
- Prolonged cytopenias: Frequent

### Extent of Added Benefit:

While the specific classification is part of the G-BA decision (not IQWiG assessment), considerations include:
- Severe disease with limited life expectancy
- High unmet medical need in third-line+ setting
- Potential for durable responses and long-term remission
- Single treatment administration vs. ongoing therapy
- Safety profile requiring specialized management
