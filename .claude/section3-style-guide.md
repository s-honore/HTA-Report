# Writing Style Guide for Section 3
## Based on Danish Ministry of Finance Publications

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity and Precision
- Use clear, direct language that conveys technical information accessibly
- Define technical terms upon first use, followed by abbreviations in parentheses
- Prefer specific numbers over vague qualifiers ("approximately DKK 13 billion" not "substantial funds")
- State methodological assumptions explicitly
- Acknowledge limitations transparently

### 2. Formal and Objective Tone
- Maintain professional distance; avoid emotive language
- Present facts without unnecessary hedging or qualifiers
- Use declarative statements: "The agreement allocates..." not "It seems the agreement might allocate..."
- Avoid superlatives unless data-supported
- No exclamation marks or casual expressions

### 3. Structure and Organization

#### Document Architecture
- Use hierarchical numbering (3.1, 3.1.1, etc.)
- Begin sections with context-setting introductory paragraphs
- Use tables for presenting reforms, investments, and status updates
- Include "Description of status" subsections for implementation details
- Cross-reference related sections using "cf." notation

#### Paragraph Structure
- Start with topic sentences that signal main point
- Support with specific evidence (dates, amounts, sources)
- Keep paragraphs focused on single themes
- Use 3-5 sentences per paragraph typically
- Maintain logical flow between paragraphs

### 4. Data and Evidence Presentation

#### Numbers and Units
- Use DKK as primary currency with EUR conversions in parentheses
  - Format: "DKK 13 billion (approx. EUR 1.75 billion)"
- Always specify time periods: "for 2024-2026" or "from 2025 onwards"
- Express percentages precisely: "1.2 percent of GDP" not "around 1%"
- Include both absolute and relative figures where relevant

#### Tables
- Use consistent column headers
- Include clear categorization (No., RRF/PA, CSR, CP, Status)
- Align numerical data appropriately
- Add footnotes for clarifications
- Source all data explicitly

### 5. Technical Rigor

#### Citations and References
- Italicize policy document titles: *Updated Medium-Term Projection, February 2025*
- Use standard agreement naming: "Agreement on [Topic] ([Month Year])"
- Include specific dates for agreements and implementation
- Reference sources in format: "cf. appendix table X.X" or "cf. figure X.X"
- Cite institutional sources: "Statistics Denmark," "Ministry of Finance"

#### Abbreviations
- Define on first use: "Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF)"
- Use consistently thereafter
- Common abbreviations: GDP, EU, DKK, EUR, GW, CO2
- Avoid creating abbreviations for terms used fewer than three times

### 6. Language Patterns

#### Sentence Construction
- Favor active voice: "The government allocated" over "Funds were allocated"
- Use present perfect for recently completed actions: "The agreement has been implemented"
- Use future tense for planned actions: "The government will present"
- Employ conditional tense appropriately: "would result in," "is expected to"

#### Connecting Ideas
- Use transitional phrases: "Furthermore," "Additionally," "At the same time,"
- Connect to previous content: "Building on this," "As part of," "In addition to"
- Signal contrast: "However," "While," "In contrast,"
- Indicate sequence: "Subsequently," "Following this," "As a result,"

#### Common Phrases
- "It has been agreed to..."
- "The agreement allocates approximately..."
- "This initiative aims to..."
- "The government, together with..."
- "A total of DKK X has been set aside for..."
- "The measure is expected to..."

### 7. Formatting Conventions

#### Emphasis
- **Bold** for key terms and section headers only
- *Italics* for document titles and occasionally for emphasis on technical terms
- No underlining
- No ALL CAPS except for established abbreviations

#### Lists
- Use bullet points for unordered items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps or prioritized items
- Introduce lists with a colon after a complete sentence
- Maintain parallel structure within lists
- Use semicolons between items if they contain commas

#### Special Elements
- Box sections for explanatory content or background information
- Footnotes for methodological details and clarifications
- Appendices for detailed data tables and supplementary information

### 8. Contextual Information

#### Time References
- Always specify exact years: "2024-2026" not "coming years"
- Use month and year for specific agreements: "June 2024"
- Distinguish between historical, current, and projected periods
- Note data cutoff dates explicitly

#### Scope and Scale
- Specify whether figures are annual, cumulative, or one-time
- Distinguish between nominal and real terms when relevant
- State whether effects are isolated or combined
- Indicate structural vs. cyclical components

### 9. Sector-Specific Conventions (for Section 3)

#### Reform Descriptions
Standard structure:
1. Name of reform/agreement with date
2. Key objectives (2-3 bullet points or sentences)
3. Financial allocation with timeframe
4. Expected outcomes (quantified where possible)
5. Implementation status
6. Cross-references to related initiatives

#### Status Updates
Categories to use:
- **On-Track**: Implementation proceeding as planned
- **Completed**: Fully implemented
- **Delayed**: Behind schedule with explanation
- **Not Completed**: Discontinued or substantially altered

### 10. Quality Checks

Before finalizing Section 3 content, verify:
- [ ] All financial figures include both DKK and EUR
- [ ] All abbreviations defined on first use
- [ ] All dates specified (month and year)
- [ ] All sources cited appropriately
- [ ] Tables formatted consistently
- [ ] Cross-references accurate
- [ ] Footnotes numbered sequentially
- [ ] No undefined jargon
- [ ] Tone remains objective throughout
- [ ] Paragraph length appropriate (not exceeding 8-10 lines)

## Examples of Good Practice

### Example 1: Policy Introduction
"In September 2022, a broad majority in the Danish Parliament reached a political agreement on a 10-year plan for psychiatry and mental health. The plan aims to ensure the necessary treatment capacity in psychiatry and strengthen the area through an annual funding increase of DKK 0.5 bn. (approx. EUR 65 mn.)."

### Example 2: Implementation Update
"The agreement has been implemented in two laws, which came into effect on March 22, 2023, and January 1, 2024, respectively."

### Example 3: Technical Detail with Transparency
"The estimates for the structural balance and structural primary balance are based solely on the Updated Medium-Term Projection, February 2025, and thus do not include the Agreement on Strengthening the Armed Forces' Combat Capability (February 2025) or new information on broader economic developments."

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Vague quantities: "significant investment" → ✅ "DKK 2 billion (approx. EUR 270 mn.)"
- ❌ Informal tone: "This will be great for..." → ✅ "This is expected to contribute to..."
- ❌ Undefined acronyms: "The RRF funds..." → ✅ "The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) funds..."
- ❌ Ambiguous time: "recently" → ✅ "in March 2024"
- ❌ Missing sources: "Studies show..." → ✅ "According to Statistics Denmark..."
- ❌ Promotional language: "innovative breakthrough" → ✅ "new initiative"
- ❌ Hedging unnecessarily: "might possibly" → ✅ "is expected to" or "may"
