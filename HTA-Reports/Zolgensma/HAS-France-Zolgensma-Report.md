## Executive Summary

The Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) Transparency Commission has conducted multiple evaluations of onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma) for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). HAS issued favorable opinions for reimbursement in specific patient populations while also recognizing significant safety concerns that required ongoing monitoring and reassessment.

### Key Recommendations Summary

**Initial Assessment (December 2020):**
- **Favorable opinion** for reimbursement in SMA type I and II (symptomatic) and presymptomatic patients with up to 3 copies of SMN2 gene
- **Unfavorable opinion** for SMA type III

**Reassessment (September 2021):**
- **Favorable opinion** maintained with additional safety monitoring requirements
- Re-evaluation requested within 1 year due to safety concerns

---

## 1. Initial Assessment (December 2020)

### 1.1 Indication Assessed

Onasemnogene abeparvovec for the treatment of patients with:
- 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)
- Bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene
- Clinical diagnosis of SMA type I, type II, or presymptomatic
- Up to 3 copies of the SMN2 gene

### 1.2 Medical Benefit Assessment (SMR - Service Médical Rendu)

The Transparency Commission evaluated the overall medical benefit provided by Zolgensma.

**SMR Rating: IMPORTANT (Substantial Medical Benefit)**

This rating was assigned for:
- Symptomatic patients with SMA type I
- Symptomatic patients with SMA type II
- Presymptomatic patients with up to 3 copies of SMN2 gene

**Rationale for IMPORTANT rating:**
- Serious and disabling disease
- Treatment is curative in intent (gene therapy)
- Favorable benefit/risk ratio
- Addresses significant unmet medical need
- Major therapeutic interest

**SMR Rating for SMA Type III: INSUFFICIENT**

The Commission concluded that the medical benefit was insufficient to justify reimbursement for SMA type III based on available evidence.

### 1.3 Improvement in Medical Benefit (ASMR)

The Commission evaluated whether Zolgensma provides improvement over existing therapies.

**ASMR Level III (Moderate Improvement):**

Assigned for:
- **Symptomatic patients with SMA type I**
- **Presymptomatic patients with 1 to 2 SMN2 gene copies**

**Rationale:**
- Zolgensma provides improvement in medical benefit at the same level as Spinraza (nusinersen)
- One-time administration offers practical advantage
- Similar efficacy to nusinersen but different administration modality
- Complements existing treatment options

**ASMR Level V (No Improvement):**

Assigned for:
- **Symptomatic patients with SMA type II**
- **Presymptomatic patients with 3 SMN2 gene copies**

**Rationale:**
- Insufficient evidence of superiority over nusinersen
- Less data available for these populations
- Cannot conclude improved benefit versus existing therapy

### 1.4 Clinical Positioning

**First-Line Treatment:**

According to HAS, Zolgensma is positioned as a **first-line treatment** on the same level as Spinraza (nusinersen) to be used in:
- All symptomatic patients with SMA type I
- Presymptomatic patients with up to 2 SMN2 gene copies

**Treatment Choice:**
- Decision between Zolgensma and nusinersen based on:
  - Patient-specific factors (age, weight, contraindications)
  - Practical considerations (one-time vs. repeated administration)
  - Safety profile
  - Shared decision-making with families

**Not Recommended:**
- HAS gave an **unfavorable opinion** for reimbursement in SMA type III
