## Executive Summary

The CADTH Canadian Drug Expert Committee (CDEC) recommends that etranacogene dezaparvovec be reimbursed for the treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with Hemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency) who require routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes, conditional upon specific criteria being met.

---

## Product Information

**Generic Name:** Etranacogene dezaparvovec
**Brand Name:** Hemgenix
**Manufacturer:** CSL Behring
**Formulation:** 1 × 10¹³ gc/mL suspension for intravenous infusion
**Indication:** Treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with hemophilia B who require routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes

---

## CDEC Recommendation

### Recommendation Decision: **REIMBURSE WITH CONDITIONS**

CDEC recommends that etranacogene dezaparvovec be reimbursed for the treatment of adults with Hemophilia B who require routine prophylaxis **only if the conditions listed are met.**

### Rationale for Recommendation

CDEC noted that:
1. Hemophilia B is a **rare and severe disease**
2. There is **significant unmet need** in this patient population
3. The limitations and uncertainty of the evidence were **balanced with the condition's rarity and unmet need**
4. Clinical evidence suggests meaningful benefit despite limitations

---

## Clinical Evidence Review

### Primary Study: HOPE-B Trial

**Study Design:**
- Phase III, single-arm, open-label clinical trial
- Adults with moderately severe to severe hemophilia B

### Key Efficacy Outcomes

#### 1. Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR)

**Result:** Etranacogene dezaparvovec decreased ABRs compared to baseline
- Evidence demonstrated clinically meaningful reduction in bleeding episodes
- Sustained effect observed through follow-up period

#### 2. Factor IX (FIX) Activity Levels

**Result:** Significant increases in endogenous FIX activity
- Patients achieved therapeutic FIX levels
- Sustained FIX expression over study period

#### 3. Reduction in FIX Infusions

**Result:** Reduced use of exogenous FIX infusions
- Decreased need for routine prophylaxis
- Many patients able to discontinue regular FIX replacement therapy

### GRADE Assessment

**Certainty of Evidence:** **LOW CERTAINTY**

The GRADE assessment concluded:
- **Low certainty** that etranacogene dezaparvovec may decrease ABRs
- **Low certainty** that treatment may reduce the use of FIX infusions
- Evidence is **uncertain** about the effect on:
  - Harms/adverse events
  - Joint health outcomes
  - Patient-reported outcomes

### Limitations of Clinical Evidence

1. **Single-arm trial design:** No randomized comparator arm
2. **Limited follow-up duration:** Long-term durability uncertain
3. **Small sample size:** Limited by rarity of condition
4. **Uncertainty in safety profile:** Limited data on long-term harms
5. **Missing patient-reported outcome data**

---

## Economic Evaluation

### Cost of Treatment

**List Price:** $4,690,000 CAD per patient (one-time treatment)

### Budget Impact Analysis

- Significant upfront cost offset by:
  - Reduction in lifetime prophylaxis costs
  - Decreased bleeding episode management
  - Reduced factor replacement therapy
  - Potential improvements in quality of life

### Cost-Effectiveness

CADTH economic review considered:
- Lifetime cost of conventional factor prophylaxis
- Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained
- Uncertainty in long-term durability of treatment effect
- Need for price reduction to achieve cost-effectiveness

---

## Reimbursement Conditions

### Conditions for Reimbursement (Table 1)

The specific conditions for reimbursement include requirements related to:
1. Patient eligibility criteria
2. Prescribing by specialized hemophilia treatment centers
3. Monitoring requirements
4. Price reduction to improve cost-effectiveness
5. Evidence collection and reporting requirements

*(Detailed conditions are outlined in the full CADTH reimbursement recommendation)*

## Patient Population

### Eligible Patients

- **Age:** 18 years or older
- **Diagnosis:** Hemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency)
- **Severity:** Requiring routine prophylaxis
- **Purpose:** To prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes

### Exclusions

Specific exclusion criteria apply, including:
- Presence of neutralizing antibodies to AAV5 above threshold
- Active or chronic infections
- Significant liver disease
- Factor IX inhibitors

---

## Safety Considerations

### Hepatocellular Carcinoma Risk

The review noted:
- One case of hepatocellular carcinoma occurred 12 months post-treatment in clinical trials
- Causality could not be definitively ruled out
- Enhanced liver monitoring required

### Immunosuppression

- Patients require immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroids)
- Duration typically several weeks to months
- Risk of infection and other steroid-related adverse events

### Other Safety Concerns

- Elevated liver enzymes
- Infusion-related reactions
- Long-term safety profile still being established

---

## Implementation Guidance

### Treatment Setting

- Must be administered at specialized hemophilia treatment centers
- Requires expertise in gene therapy and hemophilia management
- Multidisciplinary team assessment required

### Monitoring Requirements

- Pre-treatment screening for AAV5 antibodies
- Liver function monitoring (intensified post-treatment)
- Factor IX activity level monitoring
- Long-term safety surveillance including hepatocellular carcinoma screening
- Registry participation for data collection

### Patient Selection

Careful patient selection is critical, considering:
- Disease severity
- Current treatment burden
- Liver health status
- AAV5 antibody status
- Patient preferences and informed consent

---

## Stakeholder Input

### Patient Group Input

Patients highlighted:
- Significant burden of current prophylaxis regimens
- Impact on quality of life from frequent infusions
- Desire for curative or long-lasting treatment options
- Willingness to accept uncertainty for potential long-term benefit

### Clinician Input

Clinicians emphasized:
- Unmet need for alternatives to lifelong prophylaxis
- Potential to transform care for appropriate patients
- Importance of careful patient selection
- Need for long-term safety data

---

## Ethics Review

CADTH conducted an ethics review addressing:
- Informed consent considerations given uncertainty
- Equitable access to expensive gene therapy
- Long-term monitoring and registry participation
- Balancing innovation with evidence uncertainty

---

## CADTH Cost Comparison

**CADTH Cost Comparison Table** evaluated etranacogene dezaparvovec against:
- Standard factor IX prophylaxis products
- Extended half-life factor IX products
- Other hemophilia B treatment options

---

## Deliberative Framework Considerations

CDEC applied CADTH's deliberative framework for drug reimbursement, considering:

1. **Size of affected population:** Small (rare disease)
2. **Severity of condition:** High
3. **Unmet need:** Significant
4. **Clinical benefit:** Potentially transformative despite evidence limitations
5. **Economic value:** Requires price reduction for acceptable cost-effectiveness
6. **Feasibility of adoption:** Requires specialized infrastructure
7. **Ethical considerations:** Addressed in ethics review

## Regulatory Status

- **Health Canada Approval:** Approved for marketing
- **FDA Approval:** November 2022
- **EMA Approval:** February 2023

---

## Conclusions

CDEC concluded that:
1. Despite limitations in evidence, clinical benefit is probable
2. The significant unmet need in this rare disease justifies conditional reimbursement
3. Conditions for reimbursement address key concerns about cost-effectiveness and evidence gaps
4. Long-term data collection is essential
5. Patient selection and specialized center delivery are critical for appropriate use
