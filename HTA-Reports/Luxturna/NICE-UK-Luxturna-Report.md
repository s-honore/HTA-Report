# NICE (UK) Health Technology Assessment Report
## Voretigene Neparvovec (Luxturna) for Inherited Retinal Dystrophies Caused by RPE65 Gene Mutations

**Agency:** National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
**Country:** United Kingdom
**Guidance Number:** HST11
**Report Type:** Highly Specialised Technologies Evaluation
**Date:** October 2019
**Report URL:** https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/hst11

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

NICE has recommended voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna) as an option for treating RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophies in people with vision loss due to confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations who have sufficient viable retinal cells. This recommendation was made through NICE's Highly Specialised Technologies (HST) programme, which evaluates treatments for very rare conditions.

## INDICATION

Voretigene neparvovec is indicated for treating:
- Adult and pediatric patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy
- Caused by confirmed biallelic RPE65 gene mutations
- Who have sufficient viable retinal cells

---

## CLINICAL EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT

### Evidence Review
The Peninsula Technology Appraisal Group acted as the independent evidence review group (ERG) for this assessment. The ERG perspective noted:

- **Evidence Quality:** Evidence to support the effectiveness of voretigene neparvovec was limited in quantity, but the available evidence showed modest, sustained improvement across a variety of vision-related outcomes
- **Treatment Effect:** While patients would remain visually impaired, the committee considered that voretigene neparvovec would prevent further deterioration in vision
- **Long-term Data:** The evaluation considered the absence of long-term effectiveness data as a key uncertainty

### Key Clinical Outcomes
The assessment considered multiple vision-related outcomes including:
- Visual acuity (VA)
- Visual field (VF) measurements
- Multi-luminance mobility testing (MLMT)
- Patient-reported outcomes

### Methodological Challenges
- Visual acuity and visual field measurements were noted to be often unreliable because of inter-test variability
- Lack of patient-reported outcomes was identified as a key limitation
- The need for validated surrogate outcomes was highlighted

## COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS

### Base Case Results
- **List Price:** £613,410 per patient (excluding VAT)
- **Incremental Costs:** £612,404
- **Incremental QALYs:** 6.4 QALYs gained
- **Base Case ICER:** £95,072 per QALY gained

### HST QALY Weighting
Under the NICE Highly Specialised Technologies framework:
- Voretigene neparvovec is associated with a significant undiscounted QALY gain (20.5 QALYs)
- Therefore eligible for additional QALY weighting under the NICE HST process
- An ICER of up to **£205,000 per QALY gained** could be considered cost-effective under this framework
- The base case ICER of £95,072 per QALY is below this threshold

### Economic Model Considerations
- The economic evaluation used a lifetime horizon cost-utility analysis
- The model considered treatment effects on vision-related quality of life
- Uncertainty analysis addressed the limited long-term effectiveness data
- The model was sensitive to assumptions about duration of treatment effect

## COMMITTEE CONSIDERATIONS

The NICE committee considered several key factors:

1. **Unmet Medical Need:** This is the first treatment available for this rare genetic condition causing progressive vision loss and blindness

2. **Clinical Benefit:** The committee recognized that while treatment provides modest improvements, it prevents further deterioration in a severely debilitating condition

3. **Disease Rarity:** RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophy is an ultra-rare condition, justifying evaluation under the HST framework

4. **Innovation:** Voretigene neparvovec represents the first gene therapy approved for a genetic retinal disease

5. **Broader Benefits:** The committee acknowledged benefits beyond traditional QALY measurements, including:
   - Prevention of progression to complete blindness
   - Improvements in functional mobility
   - Impact on patients' ability to perform daily activities
   - Benefits to family members and caregivers

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Recommendation Status: **POSITIVE**

**NICE recommends voretigene neparvovec** as an option for treating RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophies in people with:
- Vision loss due to confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations, AND
- Sufficient viable retinal cells

### Implementation Guidance
- Voretigene neparvovec should only be used if the company provides it according to the commercial arrangement
- The technology is recommended for use within the NHS in England and Wales
- This is subject to the conditions of the managed access agreement

### Restrictions
- Treatment is limited to patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations
- Patients must have sufficient viable retinal cells remaining
- Treatment should be administered by specialists experienced in retinal surgery

---

## KEY UNCERTAINTIES

1. **Long-term Durability:** Limited data on the long-term durability of treatment effect beyond the clinical trial periods

2. **Real-world Effectiveness:** Uncertainty about effectiveness in broader patient populations outside controlled clinical trials

3. **Quality of Life Measures:** Limited validated quality of life instruments specific to this patient population

4. **Optimal Treatment Timing:** Uncertainty about the optimal age or disease stage for treatment intervention

---

## EVIDENCE GAPS IDENTIFIED

- Need for longer-term follow-up data beyond 3-4 years
- Requirement for validated, disease-specific quality of life measures
- Better understanding of factors predicting treatment response
- Data on effectiveness in different age groups and disease severity levels

---

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Budget Impact
Given the ultra-rare nature of the condition (estimated eligible population in England: approximately 100-200 patients), the overall budget impact is manageable despite the high per-patient cost.

### Patient Access
The positive recommendation enables NHS England to provide this first-in-class gene therapy to eligible patients with this rare, severely debilitating condition.
