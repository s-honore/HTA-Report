## Executive Summary

A comprehensive search for a PBAC (Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee) HTA report or assessment of Hemgenix (etranacogene dezaparvovec) for hemophilia B in Australia did not identify any publicly available documentation.

---

## Search Strategy

### Searches Conducted

1. **General Search:** "PBAC Australia Hemgenix etranacogene dezaparvovec Hemophilia B HTA report"
2. **PBS Listing Search:** "PBS Hemgenix listing Australia"
3. **PBAC Meeting Outcomes:** Searched for PBAC meeting outcomes mentioning etranacogene dezaparvovec

### Search Results

The searches returned:
- Clinical trial publications (HOPE-B study, Phase II long-term data)
- FDA and EMA regulatory approval information
- Manufacturer (CSL Behring) product information
- Academic publications on gene therapy for hemophilia B
- US and European payer assessments

**No PBAC-specific documentation was identified.**

---

## Possible Explanations

### 1. No Submission to PBAC

**Most Likely Scenario:**
- The manufacturer (CSL Behring) may not have submitted Hemgenix for PBAC review
- Given the ultra-high cost (~$3.5 million USD) and small patient population, market entry strategy may focus on other jurisdictions first

### 2. Submission in Progress or Pending

- A submission may have been made but not yet reviewed
- PBAC review may be scheduled for future meeting
- Pre-submission discussions may be ongoing

### 3. Submission Under Evaluation - Not Yet Public

- If recently submitted, the evaluation may be in progress
- PBAC outcomes are published after committee meetings
- There may be a lag between submission and public availability of outcomes

### 4. Confidential or Commercial-in-Confidence Status

- Some elements of submissions may have commercial-in-confidence status
- Public Summary Documents (PSDs) are typically published after PBAC consideration

## PBAC Process Context

### How PBAC Reviews Work

For a gene therapy like Hemgenix to be reviewed by PBAC:

1. **Submission Required:** Sponsor must submit to PBAC
2. **TGA Approval:** Must have Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approval in Australia
3. **PBAC Review:** Clinical and cost-effectiveness assessment
4. **Recommendation:** PBAC recommends for or against PBS listing
5. **Price Negotiation:** If recommended, PBAC negotiates price
6. **PBS Listing:** Final step for government reimbursement

### Special Considerations for High-Cost Therapies

Gene therapies like Hemgenix may be considered through:
- **Life Saving Drugs Program (LSDP):** For very rare conditions
- **Special arrangements:** Managed access agreements, outcomes-based contracts
- **State-based programs:** Some high-cost therapies negotiated at state level

---

## Alternative Sources Checked

### 1. PBS Website
- Searched PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) online listing
- No listing found for etranacogene dezaparvovec or Hemgenix

### 2. TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration)
- Would need to verify if Hemgenix has TGA approval in Australia
- TGA approval is prerequisite for PBS listing

### 3. CSL Behring Australia
- No public information about Australian availability
- CSL Behring is an Australian company (Melbourne-based), but Hemgenix launch strategy may prioritize other markets

### 4. Hemophilia Foundation Australia
- Could potentially have information on access programs or anticipated availability
- Patient organizations sometimes advocate for PBAC submissions

## Comparison with Other Jurisdictions

### Countries with Published HTAs

As of this search:
- **United Kingdom (NICE):** Published (TA989, July 2024)
- **Canada (CADTH):** Published (May 2024)
- **France (HAS):** Published (August 2023)
- **Germany (G-BA):** Published (October 2023)
- **Australia (PBAC):** Not found

### Access Timeline

Gene therapies often have staggered global rollout:
1. US FDA approval (November 2022)
2. European approval (February 2023)
3. Individual country HTA reviews (2023-2024)
4. Reimbursement negotiations and access (2023-2025)

Australia may be later in this sequence.

## Market Considerations for Australia

### Challenges for PBAC Submission

1. **Ultra-High Cost:** ~$3.5-4.7 million per patient
2. **Small Patient Population:** Hemophilia B is rare; severe hemophilia B even rarer
3. **Budget Impact:** Significant impact despite small numbers
4. **Long-term Uncertainty:** Durability of benefit beyond 5 years unknown
5. **Cost-Effectiveness Threshold:** May exceed Australian willingness-to-pay thresholds

### Potential Access Pathways in Australia

If/when pursued:
1. **Standard PBS listing:** Through PBAC recommendation
2. **Life Saving Drugs Program:** For eligible rare disease patients
3. **Individual patient compassionate access:** Special Access Scheme
4. **State government programs:** Victoria, NSW, or other state funding
5. **Private insurance or patient funding:** Not typical for treatments this expensive

## Conclusions

### Summary of Findings

1. **No PBAC HTA report identified** for Hemgenix (etranacogene dezaparvovec)
2. **No evidence of PBS listing** as of November 2025
3. **TGA approval status uncertain** (not confirmed in search)
4. **No public information** on Australian submission or access plans

### Likely Status

The most probable scenarios are:
- **No submission yet made to PBAC** by CSL Behring
- **Submission under consideration** but not yet publicly disclosed
- **Strategic decision** to pursue other markets first before Australian launch

### Implications

- Australian hemophilia B patients do not currently have reimbursed access to Hemgenix through PBS
- Access may be available through:
  - Clinical trials (if any in Australia)
  - Special Access Scheme (individual compassionate use)
  - Life Saving Drugs Program (if criteria met and TGA approved)
  - Private funding (unlikely given cost)

## Notes

This document summarizes the search for PBAC HTA documentation on Hemgenix. The absence of publicly available information does not necessarily indicate that no activity is occurring, but rather that no public HTA report has been published as of the search date.

If a PBAC submission has been made, the Public Summary Document (PSD) would typically be published on the PBS website following PBAC consideration at a committee meeting.

**Search Conducted:** November 11, 2025
**Recommendation:** Periodically check PBAC website for updates
