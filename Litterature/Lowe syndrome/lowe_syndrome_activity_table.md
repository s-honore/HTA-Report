## Cost Modeling Notes

### High-Cost Events (One-Time or Infrequent)
1. **Cataract surgery** (bilateral) - Early infancy
2. **Glaucoma surgeries** - Multiple possible over 0-20 years
3. **Kidney transplant** - Single event, high initial cost + lifelong immunosuppression
4. **Major complications** - Status epilepticus, acute kidney injury, etc.

### High-Cost Ongoing Services
1. **Hemodialysis** - 156 sessions/year (dominant cost in ESRD phase)
2. **Multiple specialist visits** - Accumulates significantly
3. **Intensive therapies** - Early years (ages 0-5)
4. **Medications** - Lifelong, multiple daily
5. **Special education services** - Ages 2-21

### Considerations for QALY/Quality of Life
1. **Visual impairment** - Progressive, impacts all daily activities
2. **Cognitive disability** - Wide range (borderline-normal to severe)
3. **Physical disability** - Hypotonia, motor delays, wheelchairs often needed
4. **Seizures** - If present, impacts safety and independence
5. **Dialysis burden** - Significant impact on quality of life if reached
6. **Behavior challenges** - Peak ages 8-13, may extend to adulthood

### Caregiver Burden (Indirect Costs)
1. **24/7 supervision** - Often lifelong
2. **Complex medication management** - Daily
3. **Multiple appointments** - Time off work
4. **Therapy transportation** - Frequent in early years
5. **Dialysis transportation** - 3x/week if not home-based
6. **School advocacy** - IEP meetings, coordination
