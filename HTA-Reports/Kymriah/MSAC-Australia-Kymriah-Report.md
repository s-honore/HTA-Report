# MSAC (Australia) - Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) HTA Report

## Report Overview
**Agency:** Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC), Australia
**Note:** NOT PBAC - CAR-T therapy reviewed as a 'technology' rather than a 'medicine'
**Product:** Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah)
**Sponsor:** Novartis Australia
**Funding Pathway:** National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) - Highly Specialised Therapy

## Important Clarification: MSAC vs. PBAC

### Why MSAC, Not PBAC?

**Key Distinction:**
CAR-T cell therapy is being managed as a **technology** rather than a traditional pharmaceutical 'medicine', therefore funding must be sought through the **Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC)** rather than the **Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC)**.

**Rationale:**
- CAR-T involves complex medical procedures (leukapheresis, cell processing, specialized administration)
- Not a conventional pharmaceutical product
- Requires specialized infrastructure and expertise
- Procedure-based reimbursement model more appropriate

**Funding Mechanism:**
Tisagenlecleucel funded through the **National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA)** as a **highly specialised therapy**, with costs shared between Commonwealth and States/Territories.
