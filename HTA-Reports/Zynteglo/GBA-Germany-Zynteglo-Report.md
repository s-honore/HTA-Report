## Executive Summary

The German Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) conducted an early benefit assessment of betibeglogene autotemcel (Zynteglo) under the AMNOG process (Arzneimittelmarktneuordnungsgesetz - Law on the Reform of the Market for Medicinal Products). As an **orphan medicinal product**, the additional benefit is **deemed established** through its EMA approval according to § 35a Absatz 1 Satz 11 SGB V (Social Code Book V).

The G-BA's role was to determine the **extent (magnitude) of the additional benefit** based on the approval studies, rather than to establish whether an additional benefit exists.

**Key Finding**: The assessment concluded that betibeglogene autotemcel demonstrated efficacy in achieving **transfusion independence** in 75-80% of treated patients, though the evidence was limited by **small patient numbers** and **high risk of bias** due to open, non-randomized study designs.

---

## Regulatory and Legal Framework

### Orphan Drug Status Implications

**Automatic Additional Benefit:**
- Under German law (§ 35a Absatz 1 Satz 11 SGB V), the additional benefit of an orphan drug is **considered proven by its marketing authorization**
- G-BA does NOT establish a comparator therapy for orphan drugs
- G-BA's assessment focuses on the **extent** of additional benefit, not its existence

**Evidence Base:**
- Assessment based on the **approval studies** submitted to EMA
- Quality and certainty of evidence evaluated
- Magnitude of benefit determined based on available data

### IQWiG's Limited Role for Orphan Drugs

For this orphan drug assessment, IQWiG was commissioned only to assess:
- **Module 3 of the dossier** (therapy costs and patient numbers)
- **NOT** the clinical benefit assessment (conducted by G-BA itself)

This limited role is standard procedure for orphan drugs in Germany.

---

## Clinical Evidence Assessment

### Study Design and Methodology

**Overall Assessment:**
- All available studies were **open-label, non-randomized studies**
- **High risk of bias** at both study and endpoint levels
- Small sample sizes typical of rare disease trials

**Implications:**
- Results must be interpreted with caution
- Uncertainty regarding magnitude of effect
- Difficult to rule out confounding factors

### Key Clinical Studies

#### Study HGB-204
- **Design**: Open-label, non-randomized
- **Sample Size**: 10 patients evaluated for efficacy
- **Primary Endpoint**: Transfusion independence
- **Results**: **8 of 10 patients (80%)** achieved transfusion independence

#### Study HGB-205
- **Design**: Open-label, non-randomized
- **Sample Size**: 4 patients evaluated for efficacy
- **Primary Endpoint**: Transfusion independence
- **Results**: **3 of 4 patients (75%)** achieved transfusion independence

### Combined Results
- **Overall Transfusion Independence Rate**: 11 of 14 patients (79%)
- Consistent results across both pivotal studies
- Represents a clinically meaningful outcome for patients with TDT

---

## Patient Population

### Therapeutic Indication (EMA Approval)

Betibeglogene autotemcel is indicated for the treatment of patients with:
- **Transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia (TDT)**
- Aged **12 years and older**
- **β0/β0 genotype NOT eligible** (non-β0/β0 genotypes only)
- For whom **haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is appropriate**
- Who do **NOT have a matched related HSC donor available**

### German Patient Population Estimate

**Manufacturer's Estimate:**
- Small patient population typical of rare disease
- Specific numbers provided in Module 3 (not publicly available in detail)
- Limited by strict eligibility criteria

**Factors Limiting Eligible Population:**
1. Rare disease baseline prevalence
2. Genotype restriction (excludes β0/β0)
3. Age requirement (≥12 years)
4. Must be HSC transplant candidate
5. Must lack matched related donor

---

## Assessment of Additional Benefit

### G-BA's Evaluation Framework

**For Orphan Drugs:**
1. Additional benefit is **assumed proven** by marketing authorization
2. G-BA determines the **extent (magnitude)** of additional benefit
3. Assessment based on approval studies and clinical relevance

**Potential Ratings for Extent of Benefit:**
- Major (erheblich)
- Considerable (beträchtlich)
- Minor (gering)
- Non-quantifiable (nicht quantifizierbar)

### Key Patient-Relevant Endpoint: Transfusion Independence

**Clinical Relevance:**
- Transfusion independence is a **highly patient-relevant endpoint**
- Represents freedom from:
  - Regular hospital visits for transfusions
  - Transfusion-related complications
  - Need for iron chelation therapy
  - Iron overload and organ damage
  - Infection risks from transfusions
  - Alloimmunization

**Results:**
- **80%** of patients in HGB-204 achieved transfusion independence
- **75%** of patients in HGB-205 achieved transfusion independence
- Durable response in majority of responders during follow-up

### Extent of Additional Benefit Determination

While the specific rating assigned by G-BA was not detailed in available summaries, the assessment considered:

**Positive Factors:**
- High rate of transfusion independence (75-80%)
- Clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life
- Reduction in treatment burden
- Potential curative option for patients lacking matched donors

**Limiting Factors:**
- Small patient numbers (n=14 evaluable)
- High risk of bias (open-label, non-randomized)
- Limited long-term follow-up at time of assessment
- Uncertainty about duration of effect

---

## Comparator Therapy Considerations

### Standard Care Context

**Typical Treatment for TDT:**
1. **Lifelong regular blood transfusions** (every 2-4 weeks)
2. **Iron chelation therapy** to prevent iron overload
3. **Monitoring and management** of complications

**Curative Alternative:**
- **Allogeneic HSC transplantation** from matched related donor (when available)
- Considered gold standard curative option
- Not available for most patients (lack of matched donors)

**Betibeglogene Autotemcel's Position:**
- Provides curative option when matched donor transplant not available
- Uses autologous modified cells (patient's own cells)
- Avoids risks of graft-versus-host disease

---

## Quality of Evidence Assessment

### Evidence Certainty

**Study Design Limitations:**
- **No randomization**: Higher risk of selection bias
- **Open-label**: Risk of performance and detection bias
- **Small sample sizes**: Limited statistical precision
- **Single-arm design**: No direct comparison to control group

**Impact on Certainty:**
- Evidence certainty **reduced** due to methodological limitations
- Results should be interpreted with caution
- Effect size may be uncertain

### Acceptability of Evidence

**Rationale for Acceptance Despite Limitations:**
1. **Rare disease context**: Randomized trials often not feasible
2. **Ethical considerations**: Difficult to withhold potentially curative therapy
3. **Orphan drug pathway**: Regulatory framework accommodates smaller evidence base
4. **Clinical meaningfulness**: Large effect size (80% transfusion independence) suggests genuine benefit
5. **Consistency**: Similar results across two independent studies

---

## Safety Considerations

The G-BA assessment evaluated safety data from the approval studies, though detailed safety results were not provided in available summaries.

**Key Safety Considerations for Gene Therapy:**
1. **Conditioning regimen toxicity** (myeloablation required)
2. **Engraftment success and duration**
3. **Potential for insertional mutagenesis** (vector integration risks)
4. **Long-term safety** (limited follow-up at time of assessment)
5. **Fertility impacts** (from conditioning)

---

## Economic Assessment (IQWiG Module 3 Evaluation)

### IQWiG's Limited Scope

IQWiG assessed **only Module 3** of the manufacturer's dossier:
- **Patient numbers**: Eligible population size estimates
- **Therapy costs**: Treatment costs and comparative costs

**IQWiG Did NOT Assess:**
- Clinical benefit (conducted by G-BA directly for orphan drugs)
- Quality of life data
- Overall cost-effectiveness

### Cost Considerations

**Treatment Costs:**
- One-time cost of approximately **€1.57 million** (European price)
- Additional costs for:
  - Apheresis (cell collection)
  - Cell manufacturing
  - Conditioning regimen
  - Hospitalization for administration
  - Post-infusion monitoring
  - Fertility preservation (if pursued)

**Comparative Costs:**
- Lifelong transfusion and chelation therapy ongoing costs
- Hospital visits and monitoring
- Management of complications
- Potential for cost savings over lifetime with successful treatment

## G-BA Decision and Implications

### Assessment Outcome

The G-BA completed its benefit assessment and published its decision on **May 14, 2020**. While the specific extent of additional benefit rating was not detailed in accessible summaries, the assessment acknowledged:

1. **Additional benefit established** (orphan drug status)
2. **Transfusion independence achieved** in majority of patients
3. **Evidence limitations** due to small studies and risk of bias
4. **Clinically relevant benefit** for eligible patient population

### Subsequent Development

**Important Note:**
The European Commission **withdrew the marketing authorization** for betibeglogene autotemcel on **March 24, 2022**, at the request of bluebird bio for **commercial reasons**. This occurred approximately 2 years after the G-BA assessment.

**Implications:**
- The product is no longer marketed in Germany or other EU countries
- The G-BA assessment remains a historical record of the benefit evaluation
- Withdrawal was not related to safety or efficacy concerns
- Reflects commercial challenges with ultra-high-cost therapies in European markets

---

## Post-Market Considerations (Pre-Withdrawal)

### Price Negotiation Phase

Following G-BA benefit assessment, the standard AMNOG process would involve:
1. **Price negotiations** between manufacturer and GKV-Spitzenverband (National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds)
2. Negotiations informed by extent of additional benefit determination
3. **Reimbursement price** agreed based on benefit magnitude and cost-effectiveness

**However**: The withdrawal of marketing authorization in 2022 means these negotiations may not have concluded or were not implemented.

### Access and Reimbursement (Historical)

Between May 2020 (G-BA decision) and March 2022 (withdrawal):
- Product was potentially accessible in Germany
- Reimbursement terms may have been under negotiation
- Limited uptake likely due to high cost and small eligible population

## Methodological Insights

### Challenges in Assessing Gene Therapies

This assessment highlighted several challenges:

1. **Study Design Limitations**
   - Ethical and practical barriers to randomization in rare diseases
   - Small sample sizes inherent to rare conditions
   - Open-label design necessary for complex interventions

2. **Long-term Evidence Gaps**
   - Limited follow-up at time of market entry
   - Uncertainty about lifetime durability
   - Need for ongoing registries and post-market surveillance

3. **Economic Evaluation Complexity**
   - One-time cost vs. lifetime savings modeling
   - Appropriate discount rates for delayed benefits
   - Uncertainty quantification in cost-effectiveness

4. **Appropriate Comparators**
   - No single comparator appropriate for all patients
   - Some patients have access to matched donor transplant (curative)
   - Others only have access to chronic management (palliative)

### G-BA's Adaptive Approach

The orphan drug pathway shows regulatory flexibility:
- Acknowledges evidence limitations for rare diseases
- Accepts smaller evidence base when clinically meaningful
- Balances innovation access with evidence requirements
- Provides pathway for therapies in high unmet need areas
