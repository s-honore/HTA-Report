## Executive Summary

NICE has published evidence-based recommendations on etranacogene dezaparvovec (Hemgenix) for treating moderately severe or severe haemophilia B in adults. The guidance provides recommendations for use in the NHS with managed access arrangements.

---

## Indication

Etranacogene dezaparvovec for treating moderately severe or severe haemophilia B in adults.

---

## Key Recommendations

### Managed Access

- Etranacogene dezaparvovec is recommended with managed access while more evidence is being collected
- There is a commercial access agreement for etranacogene dezaparvovec
- The technology will be available through the NHS under these managed access arrangements

### Evidence Collection

- Additional evidence on etranacogene dezaparvovec is being collected
- The managed access agreement allows NHS use while evidence generation continues

---

## Clinical Evidence Summary

### Key Clinical Trial Data

**Efficacy Outcomes:**
- **Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR):** Decreased from 4.19 during the lead-in period to 1.51 during months 7-18 after treatment
- **Rate Ratio:** 0.36, demonstrating both non-inferiority and superiority of etranacogene dezaparvovec compared with Factor IX prophylaxis
- **Bleeding Reduction:** 54% reduction in ABR compared to baseline

### Study Population

- **Study Size:** 54 participants in the pivotal trial
- **Population:** Adults with moderately severe or severe haemophilia B

### Clinical Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Increased Factor IX Activity Levels:** Subjects experienced sustained increases in Factor IX activity
2. **Reduced Need for Prophylaxis:** Decreased need for routine Factor IX replacement prophylaxis
3. **Superior Bleeding Control:** Statistically significant reduction in bleeding episodes

---

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

### Pricing

- **List Price:** US$3.5 million per dose
- **Commercial Agreement:** A confidential commercial access agreement is in place

### Economic Considerations

- NICE has agreed to managed access pending further evidence on long-term outcomes
- The high upfront cost is balanced against potential lifetime reduction in Factor IX prophylaxis costs
- Cost-effectiveness calculations include consideration of quality-of-life improvements and reduced bleeding episodes

---

## Safety Profile

The clinical trial data demonstrated acceptable safety profile consistent with the known risks of:
- AAV5 vector-based gene therapy
- Hemophilia B population characteristics
- Potential immunosuppression requirements

---

## Patient Population

### Eligible Patients

- Adults with moderately severe or severe haemophilia B
- Patients currently requiring routine prophylaxis
- Suitable candidates based on clinical assessment

---

## Implementation Guidance

### Access Pathway

- Available through NHS England managed access agreement
- Requires specialist assessment and treatment in designated hemophilia centers
- Patient selection based on clinical criteria outlined in the guidance

### Monitoring Requirements

- Long-term follow-up as part of managed access agreement
- Regular assessment of Factor IX levels
- Monitoring for adverse events and durability of response

---

## NICE Decision Rationale

NICE concluded that:
1. There is clinical benefit demonstrated in the pivotal trial
2. The managed access approach allows patients to benefit while further evidence is collected
3. The commercial agreement makes the technology cost-effective for the NHS
4. The unmet need in hemophilia B supports making this treatment available

- **European Union Approval:** February 2023
- **NICE Guidance:** July 2024 (TA989)
