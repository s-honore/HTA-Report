## ECONOMIC ANALYSIS COMPARISON

### Cost-Effectiveness Results

**List Price:**
- United States: ~$850,000 USD
- United Kingdom: £613,410
- Europe/Australia: €613,410

**ICERs Reported:**

- Ethical challenges with control groups in severe diseases

**Outcome Measurement:**
- Novel endpoints require validation
- Traditional measures (VA, VF) may not fully capture benefit

- Functional outcomes more relevant but challenging to measure

**Economic Evaluation:**
- Uncertainty in long-term effectiveness
- Limited utility data for rare diseases
- Appropriate willingness-to-pay thresholds
- One-time high-cost interventions vs. lifetime benefits
- Broader value elements difficult to quantify

**Decision-Making:**
- Balance between evidence certainty and unmet need
