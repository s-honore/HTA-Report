## German Regulatory Context

### Orphan Drug Status - Special Assessment Process

**Key Regulatory Feature:**
Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) is designated as an **orphan drug** in the European Union for all approved indications.

**Implications for Benefit Assessment:**

According to **§35a (para. 1, sentence 11) Social Code Book V**:
- The added medical benefit of orphan drugs is **deemed as proven** by the fact that they have been granted marketing authorization by the EMA
- The extent of added benefit is determined by the turnover from the medicinal product
- No additional proof of added benefit is required from the manufacturer

**IQWiG's Limited Assessment Scope:**

For orphan drugs like tisagenlecleucel, IQWiG's assessment is **restricted** to:
1. **Patient numbers** eligible for treatment
2. **Cost information** from the pharmaceutical company's dossier
3. Verification of orphan drug status and turnover thresholds

**What IQWiG Does NOT Assess (for orphan drugs):**
- Clinical effectiveness and safety (deemed proven by EMA approval)
- Comparative benefit vs. standard of care
- Quality of clinical evidence
- Risk-benefit analysis

---

## Assessment Process and Timeline

### Standard Procedure for Orphan Drugs

**Step 1: Dossier Submission**
- Manufacturer (Novartis) submits dossier to Federal Joint Committee (G-BA)
- Dossier includes patient numbers and cost information

**Step 2: IQWiG Assessment (Limited Scope)**
- Commission date: When G-BA requests IQWiG assessment
- Assessment focuses solely on:
  - Validation of eligible patient population estimates
  - Review of cost data and calculations
  - Verification of orphan status

**Step 3: IQWiG Report**
- Typically completed within 3 months
- Report sent to G-BA with findings on patient numbers and costs

**Step 4: Commenting Procedure (G-BA)**
- Stakeholders provide comments on IQWiG assessment
- Manufacturer can respond to findings
- Patient organizations and medical societies participate

**Step 5: Final Resolution (G-BA)**
- G-BA passes resolution on extent of added benefit
- Determines appropriate comparator therapy
- Sets framework for price negotiations

**Step 6: Price Negotiations**
- Reimbursement amount negotiated between GKV-Spitzenverband (statutory health insurance association) and manufacturer
- Based on extent of added benefit determined by G-BA

## Added Benefit Determination

### Extent of Additional Benefit

**Official Determination:**
Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) was granted **"non-quantifiable additional benefit"** as an orphan drug.

**Categories of Added Benefit (German system):**
1. Major added benefit
2. Considerable added benefit
3. Minor added benefit
4. Non-quantifiable added benefit (applies to orphan drugs below turnover threshold)
5. No added benefit proven
6. Less benefit than appropriate comparator therapy

**Orphan Drug Automatic Benefit:**
- Marketing authorization by EMA = proof of added benefit
- Extent determined by clinical significance and turnover
- For Kymriah: Non-quantifiable benefit recognized

## Unique Aspects of German HTA System

### Advantages of German Approach for Orphan Drugs

**1. Rapid Market Access:**
- Orphan designation = automatic proof of benefit
- No need for extensive comparative studies
- Faster patient access to innovative therapies

**2. Simplified Evidence Requirements:**
- EMA approval suffices for benefit demonstration
- Reduces manufacturer burden
- Focuses on practical implementation (patient numbers, costs)

**3. Transparent Process:**
- Public G-BA resolutions
- Clear timelines and procedures
- Stakeholder participation

### Challenges and Criticisms

**1. Limited Comparative Evidence:**
- No requirement to demonstrate superiority over existing treatments
- Uncertainty about relative effectiveness
- Challenges in determining appropriate comparator

**2. Cost Pressure:**
- High prices for orphan drugs
- Budget impact on SHI system
- Sustainability concerns with multiple CAR-T products

**3. Turnover Threshold:**
- If orphan drug exceeds €50 million annual revenue, full benefit assessment required
- May trigger reassessment with more stringent evidence requirements

---

## Comparative HTA Approach

### Germany vs. Other European HTAs

**Compared to NICE (UK):**
- **Germany:** Automatic benefit for orphan drugs, negotiated pricing
- **UK:** Full cost-effectiveness analysis even for orphan drugs, ICER thresholds

**Compared to HAS (France):**
- **Germany:** Non-quantifiable benefit category
- **France:** SMR (Medical Benefit) and ASMR (Improvement in Medical Benefit) ratings with specific levels

**Compared to IQWiG's Usual Process:**
- **Standard drugs:** Full clinical and economic assessment by IQWiG
- **Orphan drugs:** Limited assessment (patient numbers and costs only)

**Key Difference:**
Germany's orphan drug pathway provides **predictable, rapid market access** but with **less rigorous comparative evidence** than other HTA systems.
