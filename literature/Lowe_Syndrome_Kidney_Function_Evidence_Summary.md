**Title:** Long-term kidney function of Lowe syndrome: a nationwide study of paediatric and adult patients

**Journal:** Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation, Volume 39, Issue 8, August 2024, Pages 1360–1363

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfae080

**Published:** April 3, 2024

### Study Design
- **Type:** Multicentre, retrospective nationwide cohort study (Japan)
- **Sample Size:** 54 patients from 51 families
- **Pediatric patients (<20 years):** 35 patients
- **Adult patients (≥20 years):** 19 patients (largest adult Lowe syndrome cohort reported to date)
- **Study Period:** Analyzed long-term kidney function progression

### Key Quantitative Findings

#### 1. **Age-Stratified CKD Progression**

**Children (Age <20 years):**
- CKD stages G2-3: 97% (34/35 patients)
- CKD stages G4-5: 3% (1/35 patients)

**Adults (Age ≥20 years):**
- CKD stages G4-5: 84% (16/19 patients)

**Adults (Age ≥30 years):**
- CKD stages G4-5: 100% (8/8 patients)
- ESKD (CKD stage G5): 67% (6/9 patients) when restricted to those ≥30 years

#### 2. **eGFR Decline Pattern**
- **Correlation with age:** Strong negative correlation (r = -0.80, P < 0.0001)
- **Critical age threshold:** eGFR deteriorates steeply after 10 years of age
- **Progression rate:** Most patients develop ESKD by their fourth decade of life

#### 3. **Age at End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD)**
- **Median age at ESKD:** 32 years
- **Number of patients reaching ESKD:** 8 patients in cohort

#### 4. **Statistical Models**
- **Multivariate analysis:** Only age was significantly correlated with eGFR
- **Non-significant factors:**
  - Nephrocalcinosis (not associated with eGFR deterioration)
  - Hypercalciuria (not associated with eGFR deterioration)

#### 5. **Supplementary Materials Available**
- Supplementary Table S1: Details of genetic variants
- Supplementary Table S2: Phenotypes of 14 patients without genetic testing
- Supplementary Table S4: Hypercalciuria data (reduced in older patients)

### Study Limitations (as noted)
- Limited data available for univariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with eGFR
- Retrospective design
- Relatively small adult cohort (n=19, though largest reported)

## ESTIMATED PARAMETERS FOR MARKOV MODEL

### Based on Available Evidence

#### **Estimated Annual eGFR Decline Rates by Age Group**

**Note:** Specific annual decline rates in mL/min/1.73m²/year were not explicitly reported in Lowe syndrome literature. The following are derived estimates based on:
1. Strong negative correlation (r = -0.80) between age and eGFR
2. Age-stratified CKD stage distributions
3. General CKD progression literature for context

**General CKD Context (for reference):**
- Adults without CKD: ~0.9 mL/min/1.73 m²/year
- Children/young people with advanced CKD: -1.10 to -5.60 mL/min/1.73 m²/year
- Adults with advanced CKD: -1.92 to -4.12 mL/min/1.73 m²/year

**Lowe Syndrome Pattern:**
- **Age 0-10 years:** Relatively slow decline (tubular dysfunction predominant, glomerular function relatively preserved)
- **Age 10-20 years:** Accelerated decline (steep deterioration phase)
- **Age 20-30 years:** Continued rapid decline (84% reach G4-5 by end of this period)
- **Age 30+ years:** Progression to ESKD (100% have G4-5, 67% reach ESKD)

#### **Baseline eGFR Estimates by Age Cohort**

Based on Zaniew 2018 (median eGFR 58.8 mL/min/1.73 m² in pediatric cohort) and Ando 2024 (progression patterns):

| Age Range | Estimated Mean eGFR | CKD Stage Distribution | Key Milestone |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| 0-10 years | 70-90 mL/min/1.73 m² | Mostly G1-G2 | Onset of glomerular decline |
| 10-20 years | 40-70 mL/min/1.73 m² | G2-G3 (97% <G4) | Steep decline phase |
| 20-30 years | 20-40 mL/min/1.73 m² | G4-G5 (84% ≥G4) | Advanced CKD |
| 30+ years | <20 mL/min/1.73 m² | G4-G5 (100% ≥G4) | ESKD progression |

**Note:** These are estimates derived from available data. Individual variation exists.

#### **Transition Probabilities for Markov Model**

**Estimated Annual Transition Rates:**

| From State | To State | Age <20 | Age 20-30 | Age 30+ | Source/Justification |
|------------|----------|---------|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| CKD G2-3 | CKD G4-5 | ~3% | High | 100% | Ando 2024: 3% G4-5 <age 20 |
| CKD G4-5 | ESKD | Low | High | ~67% | Ando 2024: 67% ESKD ≥age 30 |
| ESKD | Death | Variable | Variable | Variable | Median ESKD at 32y, death 30-40y |

## DATA GAPS AND LIMITATIONS

### Missing Quantitative Parameters
1. **Specific annual eGFR decline rates** (mL/min/1.73 m²/year) not explicitly reported in Lowe syndrome studies
2. **Exact baseline eGFR values by age group** - only median for entire cohort available (58.8 in Zaniew 2018)
3. **Individual patient-level data** not accessible
4. **Survival curves** not published in detail
5. **eGFR at specific ages** (e.g., mean eGFR at age 15, 20, 25, 30) not reported

### Methodological Limitations
1. **Retrospective design** in all major studies
2. **Small sample sizes**, especially for adults (n=19 in Ando 2024)
3. **Cross-sectional eGFR measurements** rather than longitudinal tracking
4. **Full text access blocked** - unable to access:
   - Supplementary materials with additional data
   - Detailed figures and tables
   - Statistical appendices
   - Individual patient data

### Recommendations for Model Development
1. **Use sensitivity analysis** around eGFR decline rates
2. **Consider age-stratified models** given strong age-eGFR correlation (r=-0.80)
3. **Apply general CKD progression rates** as proxy where Lowe-specific data unavailable
4. **Model median age at ESKD** (32 years) as key transition point
5. **Consider beta distribution** for transition probabilities based on percentages
6. **Validate against survival data** (life expectancy 30-40 years)

## ADDITIONAL CLINICAL CONTEXT

### Other Mortality Factors
- **Respiratory illness**
- **Seizures**
- **Infections**
- **Neurological complications**

These factors should be considered in mortality rates beyond renal failure alone.

### Quality of Life Factors
- **Fanconi syndrome** requires ongoing supplementation (electrolytes, carnitine)
- **Progressive CKD** impacts quality of life
- **Dialysis/transplant** needs in ESKD
- **Neurological impairment** affects all aspects of care
- **Ocular disease** (cataracts, glaucoma)
