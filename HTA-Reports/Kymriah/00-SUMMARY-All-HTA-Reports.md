## Key Themes Across HTA Agencies

### 1. Clinical Evidence Evaluation

**Strengths Recognized:**
- High response rates in heavily pre-treated, refractory populations
- Potential for durable remissions and curative outcomes
- Significant unmet medical need
- Innovative mechanism of action (paradigm shift)

**Concerns Identified:**
- Single-arm trial designs (no randomized controls)
- Limited long-term follow-up at initial assessment
- Small sample sizes
- Uncertainty in comparative effectiveness
- Patient selection effects
- Lack of data in some subpopulations

**Evidence Quality Assessment:**
- **ALL:** Generally rated as higher quality due to more limited alternatives
- **DLBCL:** More scrutiny due to availability of other treatments and smaller single-arm studies
- **FL:** Most recent, with similar concerns as DLBCL

---

### 2. Economic Evaluation Approaches

**Cost-Effectiveness Challenges:**

| Agency | Approach | Key Finding |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **NICE** | ICER with flexibility for end-of-life | Required commercial discount to meet threshold |
| **CADTH** | ICER analysis with reanalyses | $193K-$434K/QALY - price reduction needed |
| **IQWiG** | Limited cost assessment (orphan drug) | No full cost-effectiveness required |
| **HAS/CEESP** | Full economic evaluation (from 2019) | ICER invalidated - not proven cost-effective |
| **MSAC** | Cost-effectiveness with AU thresholds | Evaluated against $50K-$75K AUD/QALY |

**Common Economic Concerns:**
1. **High upfront cost** (~$282,000-$475,000 depending on market)
2. **Uncertainty in long-term benefit** extrapolation
3. **One-time curative vs. ongoing therapy** valuation challenges
4. **Limited comparative data** for economic modeling
5. **Budget impact** on healthcare systems

**Economic Conclusions:**
- No agency found tisagenlecleucel cost-effective at launch prices without discounts
- All required or expected price reductions through confidential commercial arrangements
- Innovative payment models explored (outcomes-based, installment payments)

---

### 3. Reimbursement Strategies

**Conditional Approval Mechanisms:**

**Coverage with Evidence Development (CED):**
- **NICE:** Cancer Drugs Fund for evidence generation
- **HAS:** Outcomes-based reimbursement with reassessment
- **CADTH:** Conditional reimbursement with price reduction requirement
- **MSAC:** Highly specialized therapy with registry participation

**Common Conditions:**
1. **Restricted patient population** matching trial eligibility
2. **Qualified treatment centers only**
3. **Registry participation** for real-world evidence
4. **Price discounts** (confidential commercial arrangements)
5. **Reassessment** after defined period with updated data

---

### 4. Unique Regulatory Approaches

#### Germany (IQWiG): Orphan Drug Pathway
- **Automatic benefit** deemed proven by EMA approval
- **No comparative effectiveness** assessment required
- **Rapid market access** - most streamlined process
- **Focus on patient numbers and costs** for budget planning
- **Price negotiation** follows G-BA benefit determination

#### United Kingdom (NICE): Fast-Track Innovation
- **Fastest EU approval** for ALL (10 days post-EMA)
- **Cancer Drugs Fund** enables conditional funding
- **Flexible ICER thresholds** for end-of-life treatments
- **Real-world evidence** requirements built into CED

#### France (HAS): Two-Tier Assessment
- **SMR rating** (absolute clinical benefit): Important
- **ASMR rating** (comparative improvement): Variable by indication
- **CEESP economic evaluation** (since 2019): Rigorous, invalidated ICERs
- **Outcomes-based contracting**: Performance-linked reimbursement

#### Canada (CADTH): Comprehensive Review
- **Integrated assessment:** Clinical, economic, ethics, budget impact
- **Explicit ICER thresholds:** $50,000/QALY reference
- **Conditional recommendations:** Price reduction requirements stated
- **Ethics review:** Equity and access considerations formalized

#### Australia (MSAC): Technology-Based
- **MSAC not PBAC:** CAR-T as technology, not traditional medicine
- **NHRA funding:** Highly specialized therapy mechanism
- **Multiple meetings:** Deliberative process with stakeholder input
- **Geographic focus:** Equity across vast distances, Indigenous health

## Comparative Effectiveness: Tisagenlecleucel vs. Other CAR-T Products

### Available Comparators

**CD19-Directed CAR-T Therapies:**
1. **Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta)** - Kite/Gilead
2. **Brexucabtagene autoleucel (Tecartus)** - Kite/Gilead
3. **Lisocabtagene maraleucel (Breyanzi)** - BMS/Juno

**Evidence Gaps:**
- No head-to-head randomized trials
- Indirect comparisons limited by patient selection differences
- Real-world comparative effectiveness studies emerging
- Network meta-analyses constrained by data availability

**HTA Considerations:**
- Multiple products available for DLBCL
- Product selection based on patient factors, center experience, availability
- Pricing and reimbursement negotiations influenced by competition
- Reassessments may compare multiple CAR-T products

---

## Key Lessons from HTA Evaluations

### 1. Orphan Drug Pathways Accelerate Access
- **Germany's automatic benefit** for orphan drugs provided fastest market access
- **Trade-off:** Less rigorous comparative evidence vs. rapid patient access
- **Evolution:** Reassessments occur as evidence matures

### 2. Evidence Generation is Dynamic
- Initial approvals often conditional on further evidence
- Real-world registries inform reassessments
- Long-term follow-up changes risk-benefit assessment
- Outcomes-based contracts align with evidence uncertainty

### 3. Economic Models Face Challenges with Curative Therapies
- Traditional cost-effectiveness methods struggle with one-time treatments
- Uncertainty in long-term cure rates complicates extrapolations
- Valuing potential cure vs. life extension difficult
- New frameworks needed for transformative therapies

### 4. Price is Critical for All HTAs
- No agency found tisagenlecleucel cost-effective at launch prices
- Confidential discounts essential for positive decisions
- Outcomes-based pricing manages uncertainty
- Competition from other CAR-T products affects negotiations

### 5. Implementation is Complex
- CAR-T requires specialized infrastructure beyond traditional drug delivery
- Qualified center networks take time to establish
- Geographic equity remains challenging
- Capacity constraints may limit access even with funding approval

### 6. Patient Selection is Critical
- Restrictive eligibility criteria based on trial populations
- Performance status and organ function requirements exclude some patients
- Balance between maximizing benefit and broader access
- Real-world eligibility may be more restrictive than labels

## Conclusions

### Cross-Country HTA Insights

**Universal Recognition:**
All five HTA agencies recognized tisagenlecleucel provides **important clinical benefit** for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies, particularly pediatric/young adult ALL where alternatives are very limited.

**Evidence-Based Decision Making:**
Despite recognized clinical benefit, all agencies demanded:
- Price reductions from launch prices
- Conditional approvals with evidence generation
- Restriction to qualified treatment centers
- Real-world evidence collection

**Methodological Evolution:**
Tisagenlecleucel assessments demonstrate HTA systems adapting to:
- Curative one-time therapies
- High upfront costs with uncertain long-term value
- Orphan drug evidence constraints
- Need for innovative payment models

**Patient Access:**
While all countries provide funding/reimbursement, access remains limited by:
- Restrictive eligibility criteria
- Qualified center capacity
- Geographic barriers
- Clinical factors (performance status, comorbidities)

**Future Trajectory:**
As CAR-T therapies mature:
- Long-term evidence will reduce uncertainty
- Competition will affect pricing
- Expanded indications will broaden access
- Healthcare systems will build capacity
- Methods for assessing transformative therapies will improve

---

### Final Thoughts

The HTA evaluations of tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) represent a **pivotal moment** in health technology assessment, challenging traditional frameworks and demanding innovation in:
1. **Evidence generation** for rare diseases and novel modalities
2. **Economic valuation** of potentially curative therapies
3. **Reimbursement models** managing uncertainty and high costs
4. **Healthcare system implementation** of complex cellular therapies
5. **Equity** in access to transformative innovations

These reports collectively inform the **global conversation** on how healthcare systems can balance innovation, access, affordability, and evidence in the era of advanced cell and gene therapies.
