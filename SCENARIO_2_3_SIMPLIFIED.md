### Scenario 2: Intermediate Kidney Protection

**eGFR Trajectory: Partial Pathological Decline Reduction.** Scenario 2 models an intermediate outcome wherein gene therapy provides substantial but incomplete kidney protection. Treatment effect parameter: θ = 0.50 (50% reduction in pathological decline). Decline rate: D_treated = D_age + (1 - 0.50) × D_path = 0.3 + 0.50 × 0.80 = **0.70 ml/min/1.73m²/year**. Treated patients experience 0.70 ml/min/year decline (versus 1.10 natural history), representing substantial disease modification that delays but does not prevent ESKD. Starting from eGFR_0 = 70 ml/min/1.73m² at age 5, patients reach ESKD threshold (15 ml/min/1.73m²) at approximately age 84 (versus age 32 untreated), delaying ESKD by 52 years.

**Clinical Outcomes.** ESKD delay: +52 years (from age 32 to age 84). Life expectancy: 65-70 years (versus 42 years natural history; +23-28 years gained). Quality of life: Maintained in CKD Stage 2-3 through age 50, progressing to Stage 4-5 in senior years. eGFR at age 40: ~45 ml/min/1.73m² (CKD Stage 3a) versus 30 ml/min/1.73m² (CKD Stage 3b) natural history.

**Scenario Justification.** The θ = 0.50 parameter represents the midpoint between complete protection (Scenario 1, θ=1.0) and no benefit (natural history, θ=0), providing a plausible intermediate efficacy outcome for economic modeling. This scenario could result from: suboptimal vector biodistribution to kidney tissue (liver sequestration limiting kidney exposure); inadequate transduction of critical renal cell populations (proximal tubule); or gradual waning of transgene expression over years. Without clinical trial data or mechanistic dose-response understanding linking enzyme restoration levels to eGFR outcomes, this scenario serves to bound value estimates between optimistic (Scenario 1) and pessimistic (Scenario 3) outcomes.

### Scenario 3: Minimal Kidney Protection

**eGFR Trajectory: Limited Pathological Decline Reduction.** Scenario 3 models a pessimistic outcome wherein gene therapy provides limited kidney protection. Treatment effect parameter: θ = 0.20 (20% reduction in pathological decline). Decline rate: D_treated = D_age + (1 - 0.20) × D_path = 0.3 + 0.80 × 0.80 = **0.94 ml/min/1.73m²/year**. Treated patients experience 0.94 ml/min/year decline (versus 1.10 natural history), representing minimal disease modification (15% slower progression). Starting from eGFR_0 = 70 ml/min/1.73m² at age 5, patients reach ESKD at approximately age 63 (versus age 32 untreated), delaying ESKD by 31 years.

**Clinical Outcomes.** ESKD delay: +31 years (from age 32 to age 63). Life expectancy: ~55 years (versus 42 years natural history; +13 years gained). Quality of life: Modest benefit; progression through CKD stages only slightly delayed. eGFR at age 40: ~37 ml/min/1.73m² (CKD Stage 3b, same stage as natural history).

**Scenario Justification.** The θ = 0.20 parameter represents conservative lower-bound efficacy for economic modeling. This scenario could result from: poor renal vector tropism (preferential targeting of liver and muscle over kidney; Zincarelli et al. 2008); inadequate vector dosing for kidney transduction; immune responses limiting kidney-specific transgene expression; or failure to transduce critical renal cell populations. While analogies to other enzyme replacement therapies (hemophilia B, Gaucher disease) suggest minimal enzyme restoration typically provides minimal clinical benefit (Miesbach 2021; Beutler & Grabowski 2001), we cannot directly translate enzyme-activity thresholds to eGFR outcomes without clinical data. Scenario 3 defines the lower bound for "successful but inadequate" gene therapy; θ < 0.20 would represent treatment failure scenarios not modeled in this analysis.

**Clinical Trial Design Implications.** Scenarios 2 and 3 highlight the critical importance of **eGFR as the primary endpoint** in early-phase trials. While enzyme restoration measurements (serum, fibroblasts, kidney biopsy) provide mechanistic insights, eGFR trajectory over 12-24 months post-treatment will determine clinical value. If Phase 1/2 data demonstrate eGFR decline rates of 0.7-0.9 ml/min/year (consistent with Scenarios 2-3), developers should carefully weigh whether to proceed to Phase 3 given limited cost-effectiveness at these efficacy levels (ICERs >€1M/QALY).

**Summary of Treatment Effect Scenarios.** All scenarios assume immediate treatment effect onset at age 5 and lifelong durability without waning. While optimistic regarding durability, this assumption aligns with long-term follow-up data from other AAV gene therapies demonstrating sustained transgene expression beyond 10 years (Nathwani et al. 2014; Russell et al. 2017). These assumptions favor treatment and represent best-case durability and safety profiles. Real-world outcomes may be less favorable if immune responses emerge, transgene expression wanes, or off-target effects occur.
