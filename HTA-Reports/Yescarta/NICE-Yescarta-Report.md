## Executive Summary

NICE Technology Appraisal TA872 provides updated guidance on axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta, Kite Pharma) for treating relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL) in adults after 2 or more systemic therapies. This guidance updates and replaces the previous NICE technology appraisal guidance TA559 from January 2019.

## 1. Recommendation

Axicabtagene ciloleucel is **recommended**, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL) in adults after 2 or more systemic therapies.

This recommendation is made **only if**:
- The conditions in the commercial arrangement are met

## 2. Clinical Evidence Overview

### Technology Description
- **Generic Name:** Axicabtagene ciloleucel
- **Brand Name:** Yescarta
- **Manufacturer:** Kite Pharma (Gilead Sciences)
- **Mechanism:** CAR T-cell therapy targeting CD19-positive B cells
- **Administration:** One-time intravenous infusion after lymphodepleting chemotherapy

### Target Population
Adults with:
- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, OR
- Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL), OR
- Follicular lymphoma grade 3B
- That is refractory to or relapsed after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy

### Clinical Effectiveness Evidence
The clinical evidence package included:
- **ZUMA-1 study**: Pivotal single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 study
- Long-term follow-up data demonstrating durable responses
- Real-world evidence from UK and international registries

Key efficacy outcomes:
- Objective response rates
- Complete response rates
- Duration of response
- Overall survival
- Progression-free survival

### Safety Profile
Common adverse events include:
- Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
- Neurological toxicities
- Cytopenias
- Infections

## 3. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

### Economic Model
NICE evaluated a cost-effectiveness model submitted by the company that compared axicabtagene ciloleucel with:
- Standard of care chemotherapy regimens
- Best supportive care

### Key Economic Considerations

**End-of-Life Criteria:**
Axicabtagene ciloleucel meets NICE's criteria to be considered a life-extending treatment at the end of life:
- The treatment is indicated for patients with a short life expectancy (normally less than 24 months)
- There is sufficient evidence to indicate that the treatment offers an extension to life (normally of at least an additional 3 months)

**Cost-Effectiveness Results:**
Taking the end-of-life criteria into account, the cost-effectiveness estimates for axicabtagene ciloleucel are within what NICE considers an acceptable use of NHS resources.

### Commercial Arrangement
There is a **simple discount patient access scheme** for axicabtagene ciloleucel. The financial details are commercial-in-confidence.

## 4. Committee Discussion

### Positive Factors Considered:
1. **Significant clinical benefit:** Axicabtagene ciloleucel provides durable responses in patients with limited treatment options
2. **Unmet medical need:** Patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL and PMLBCL after 2+ lines of therapy have poor prognosis and limited alternatives
3. **Quality of life:** Potential for long-term remission offers substantial quality of life benefits
4. **Innovation:** CAR T-cell therapy represents a step-change in treatment approach

### Areas of Uncertainty:
1. Long-term survival projections
2. Real-world effectiveness compared to trial data
3. Patient selection and eligibility in clinical practice
4. Treatment administration and safety management requirements

### Patient and Clinical Expert Input:
- Patient representatives emphasized the devastating impact of relapsed/refractory disease
- Clinical experts noted that axicabtagene ciloleucel fills an important gap in the treatment pathway
- Recognition of the need for specialist centers and infrastructure

## 5. Implementation Considerations

### Healthcare System Requirements:
- Administration must occur at authorized CAR-T treatment centers
- Requirements for apheresis facilities
- Intensive monitoring for adverse events (CRS, neurotoxicity)
- Bridging therapy may be needed during manufacturing period (typically 3-4 weeks)

### Resource Impact:
- Estimated patient numbers eligible for treatment in England
- One-time treatment cost but requires significant support infrastructure
- Budget impact analysis provided (commercial-in-confidence)

## 6. Evolution from Previous Guidance

### From TA559 (January 2019):
The previous guidance (TA559) recommended axicabtagene ciloleucel as an option for use within the **Cancer Drugs Fund** (CDF), with evidence collection required.

### Updates in TA872 (February 2023):
Following the collection of additional evidence, particularly:
- Longer-term survival data from ZUMA-1
- Real-world evidence from NHS England and other sources
- Updated economic modeling

The committee concluded that axicabtagene ciloleucel met the criteria for **routine commissioning** in the NHS, graduating from the Cancer Drugs Fund.

## 7. Recommendations for Further Research

Areas identified for ongoing evidence generation:
- Long-term survival and late effects
- Predictive biomarkers for response
- Optimal patient selection
- Sequencing with other novel therapies
- Real-world effectiveness and safety

## 8. References and Related Guidance

### Related NICE Guidance:
- **TA559** - Previous guidance (January 2019) - now replaced by TA872
- **TA895** - Axicabtagene ciloleucel for treating relapsed or refractory DLBCL after first-line chemoimmunotherapy (second-line indication)
- Other CAR-T therapies for lymphoma

## 9. Conclusion

NICE recommends axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) as a routine commissioning option for adults with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma after 2 or more systemic therapies. This positive recommendation recognizes the significant clinical benefit, the unmet need in this patient population, and acceptable cost-effectiveness when considering end-of-life criteria and the commercial arrangement.
