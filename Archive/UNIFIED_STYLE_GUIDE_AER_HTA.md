# UNIFIED STYLE GUIDE: AER-HTA HYBRID APPROACH
## For Lowe Syndrome Gene Therapy HTA Report

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** November 11, 2025
**Purpose:** Establish consistent writing style combining American Economic Review (AER) academic rigor with Health Technology Assessment (HTA) practical comprehensiveness

---

## I. EXECUTIVE PHILOSOPHY

This guide synthesizes two distinct writing traditions:

1. **AER Academic Style:** Analytical, concise, methodologically rigorous economic writing suitable for peer-reviewed publication
2. **HTA Report Style:** Comprehensive, accessible, implementation-focused writing for healthcare decision-makers

**Our Hybrid Approach:**
- Adopt AER formatting conventions (tables, equations, citations) for academic credibility
- Retain HTA comprehensiveness and practical detail for decision-making utility
- Balance analytical tone with accessibility
- Maintain methodological rigor while addressing real-world implementation

---

## II. DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

---

## III. WRITING TONE AND STYLE

### A. General Principles

**1. Analytical Clarity (AER)**
- Present evidence objectively
- Explain economic trade-offs analytically
- Cite literature to support claims
- Avoid marketing language or advocacy

**Good Example:**
> "The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 328,288 dollars per QALY exceeds conventional thresholds of 100,000 to 150,000 dollars per QALY but falls within ranges considered for ultra-rare diseases under NICE's Highly Specialised Technologies framework (up to 300,000 pounds per QALY, approximately 380,000 dollars)."

**Avoid:**
> "This groundbreaking therapy offers amazing value and should definitely be adopted by all healthcare systems."

**2. Accessible Precision (HTA)**
- Define technical terms on first use
- Use clear subsection headings
- Include bullet points for complex information
- Explain clinical and economic concepts for multidisciplinary audience

**Good Example:**
> "Lowe syndrome is caused by mutations in the *OCRL* gene, which encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase enzyme. This enzyme deficiency leads to three primary manifestations:
> - Congenital cataracts (100% of patients)
> - Intellectual disability (90% of patients)
> - Progressive kidney failure (100% of patients)"

**3. Conciseness with Completeness**
- AER principle: Eliminate unnecessary words
- HTA adaptation: Retain essential detail for decision-making
- Move highly technical content to appendices
- Main text should be self-contained but not exhaustive

**Apply These Rules:**
- "in order to" → "to"
- "whether or not" → "whether"
- "is equal to" → "equals"
- BUT: Do not sacrifice clarity for brevity in HTA sections (e.g., eligibility criteria, monitoring requirements)

### B. Voice and Perspective

**Use First Person Plural (Standard in Both Styles):**
- "We evaluate..."
- "Our analysis demonstrates..."
- "We estimate..."
- "The model predicts..."

**Avoid:**
- Passive voice when active is clearer
- "It is shown that..." → "We show that..."
- "It can be seen..." → "Table 1 shows..."

### C. Language Conventions

**Economics/HTA Terminology:**

**Appropriate:**
- "We estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio..."
- "Results suggest gene therapy may be cost-effective under optimistic scenarios"
- "The model predicts ESKD onset at age 28..."
- "Controlling for baseline characteristics..."
- "Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)"
- "Willingness-to-pay threshold"

**Avoid:**
- Marketing superlatives ("revolutionary", "unprecedented", "game-changing")
- Unqualified certainty ("This will definitely work")
- Excessive hedging ("might possibly perhaps potentially")

## V. MATHEMATICAL CONTENT

### A. Equations (AER Standard, Essential for Methodology)

**Format:**
- Display equations on separate lines
- Number consecutively at left margin: (1), (2), (3)
- Define all variables immediately after equation
- Use italics for scalars, boldface for vectors/matrices

**Example:**
```
The annual eGFR decline follows:

(1)    eGFR_{t+1} = eGFR_t - δ × (1 - θ)

where δ is the natural decline rate (ml/min/1.73m²/year) and θ ∈ [0, 1] is
the treatment effect parameter.

The transition probability to ESKD is:

(2)    P(ESKD_t) = 1   if eGFR_t < 15
                 = 0   otherwise
```

**In-text fractions:** Use slash with clear parentheses
- Example: "The ratio (a + b)/(c + d) represents..."

### B. Notation Conventions

**Scalars:** *Italic* (e.g., *eGFR*, *t*, *c*, *δ*, *θ*)
**Vectors:** **Boldface** (e.g., **x**, **β**)
**Matrices:** **Boldface** (e.g., **X**, **Σ**)
**Sets:** Script (e.g., 𝒮, 𝒳) or ℝ, ℤ, ℕ for real/integers/natural numbers

**Subscripts and Superscripts:**
- Maximum two levels
- Example: *x*_{*i*,*t*} acceptable; *x*_{*i*,*t*,*j*}^{*k*,*l*} too complex

### C. When to Use Equations vs. Prose

**Use Equations For:**
- Core model structure (transition probabilities, Markov processes)
- Key calculations (ICER formula, discounting)
- Parameter relationships requiring mathematical precision

**Use Prose For:**
- Descriptive clinical parameters (prevalence, natural history)
- Implementation details (eligibility criteria, monitoring protocols)

## IX. STYLE COMPARISON EXAMPLES

### A. Disease Background Description

**Pure AER Style (Too Concise for HTA):**
```
Lowe syndrome is an X-linked disorder causing renal failure, with median ESKD
onset at age 32 (Ando et al. 2024). No disease-modifying treatments exist.
```

**Pure HTA Style (Too Descriptive for Economics):**
```
Lowe syndrome, also called oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe, is a very rare
genetic condition that affects multiple parts of the body. Patients experience
problems with their eyes (cataracts), brain (intellectual disability), and
kidneys (kidney failure). It is caused by changes in a gene called OCRL on the
X chromosome. Families face tremendous challenges caring for affected children.
```

**Our Hybrid Style (Balanced):**
```
Lowe syndrome is a rare, X-linked recessive disorder characterized by the
classic triad of congenital cataracts, intellectual disability, and progressive
renal failure (Attree et al. 2006). The condition results from pathogenic
mutations in the *OCRL* gene, leading to deficiency of a phosphatidylinositol
phosphatase enzyme. Progressive kidney disease is the primary driver of
mortality, with median ESKD onset at age 32 (Ando et al. 2024). Currently, no
disease-modifying treatments exist; all management is symptomatic.
```

### B. Cost-Effectiveness Results

**Pure AER Style:**
```
III. Results

A. Base Case

Table 1 presents results. Complete stabilization yields an ICER of 328,288
dollars per QALY (SE 42,155).
```

**Pure HTA Style:**
```
Results

What We Found

The complete stabilization scenario (where the gene therapy completely stops
kidney disease from getting worse) costs an extra $2,258,437 but provides an
additional 6.879 quality-adjusted life years. This means the cost per QALY
gained is $328,288.

This is higher than the usual threshold of $150,000 per QALY that is often
used, but it is within the range that might be acceptable for very rare diseases
like Lowe syndrome.
```

**Our Hybrid Style:**
```
IV. Results

A. Base Case Cost-Effectiveness

Table 1 presents lifetime costs, QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios for each treatment scenario relative to natural history. Under natural
history, patients starting at age 5 with eGFR 70 ml/min/1.73m² reach ESKD by
year 5, accumulate 5.87 discounted QALYs over 17.05 life years, and incur total
discounted costs of 1,229,454 dollars.

When gene therapy completely prevents eGFR decline (θ = 1.0), patients maintain
CKD Stage 2 kidney function throughout their lifetime, never progressing to
ESKD. Life expectancy extends to 36.84 years, and patients accumulate 12.75
discounted QALYs. Total lifetime costs rise to 3,487,890 dollars, driven by the
3,000,000 dollar gene therapy acquisition cost and prolonged CKD Stage 2
management costs.

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is 328,288 dollars per QALY gained
(standard error 42,155 dollars). While exceeding conventional cost-effectiveness
thresholds of 100,000 to 150,000 dollars per QALY commonly referenced in United
States health technology assessment (Neumann et al. 2014), the ICER falls within
ranges considered for ultra-rare diseases under NICE's Highly Specialised
Technologies framework (up to 300,000 pounds per QALY, approximately 380,000
dollars) (NICE 2017).
```

## XI. SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS FOR LOWE SYNDROME REPORT

### A. Tone Adjustments for Ultra-Rare Disease

**Acknowledge Uncertainty:** Ultra-rare diseases have limited data; be explicit
```
Good: "Absent clinical trial data for gene therapy in Lowe syndrome, we model
three treatment effect scenarios representing varying degrees of efficacy."

Avoid: "Gene therapy will achieve 70% reduction in eGFR decline."
```

**Emphasize Unmet Need:** Justified given severity and lack of alternatives
```
Appropriate: "Lowe syndrome represents a condition with profound unmet medical
need characterized by progressive, fatal disease course with no disease-modifying
treatments available."
```

**Discuss Broader Value:** More important for rare diseases than common conditions
```
Include discussion of: family burden, insurance value, severity modifier,
real option value of treating now vs. waiting for more data
```

### B. Handle Absence of Clinical Data

**Be Transparent:**
```
"We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AAV-based gene therapy for Lowe syndrome
using a Markov cohort model. Absent clinical trial data, we model three
treatment effect scenarios representing plausible efficacy ranges based on
mechanistic understanding of OCRL enzyme restoration and precedent from related
gene therapies (Luxturna, Zolgensma)."
```

**Use Scenario Analysis Extensively:**
- Do not rely on single "base case" prediction
- Present multiple scenarios with clear efficacy assumptions
- Conduct threshold analysis (what efficacy level is needed for cost-effectiveness?)

### C. Emphasize Renal Focus

**Rationale for Kidney-Specific Modeling:**
```
"While Lowe syndrome affects multiple organ systems, we focus our economic
evaluation on renal outcomes for several reasons. First, progressive kidney
failure is the primary driver of mortality (Ando et al. 2024). Second, eGFR
decline provides a quantifiable, validated endpoint suitable for cost-
effectiveness modeling. Third, renal disease progression is potentially
modifiable through early intervention, unlike congenital ocular abnormalities
present at birth. Fourth, the economic impact of ESKD (dialysis costs exceeding
135,000 dollars annually) generates substantial potential offsets to gene therapy
acquisition costs."
```
