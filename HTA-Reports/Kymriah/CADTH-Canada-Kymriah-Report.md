## Executive Summary

### Follicular Lymphoma Reimbursement Recommendation (2023)

**CADTH Recommendation:** CONDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT
**Decision Date:** September 2023

#### Recommendation Statement
CADTH recommends that tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) be **reimbursed by public drug plans** for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory grade 1, 2, or 3a follicular lymphoma after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy **if certain conditions are met**.

#### Conditions for Reimbursement

**Patient Eligibility Criteria:**
1. Patients must have grade 1, 2, or 3a follicular lymphoma (FL)
2. Disease must have:
   - Not responded to a second or later line of treatment, OR
   - Returned within 6 months after 2 or more treatments, OR
   - Returned after an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT)
3. Patients have not already received a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy
4. Patients are in relatively good health (adequate performance status)

**Economic Conditions:**
- A price reduction is required for tisagenlecleucel to achieve cost-effectiveness
- Cost must be reduced to reach acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio

---

## Clinical Evidence Review

### Evidence Base
CADTH reviews included evaluation of:
- Pivotal clinical trials (ELIANA for pALL, JULIET for DLBCL)
- Long-term follow-up data
- Real-world evidence where available
- Comparative effectiveness vs. standard of care

### Key Clinical Findings

**Efficacy:**
- High response rates in heavily pre-treated populations
- Durable remissions observed in responders
- Potential for curative outcomes

**Safety:**
- Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) manageable with tocilizumab
- Neurological toxicities require monitoring
- Infrastructure and expertise required for administration

**Uncertainty:**
- Limited long-term survival data at initial assessment
- Single-arm trial designs limit comparative evidence
- Patient selection effects in real-world use

---

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

### Economic Evaluation Summary

**Follicular Lymphoma (2023):**

**Base Case ICER:**
- Range: $193,516 to $434,036 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained
- Based on CADTH reanalyses with adjustments for uncertainty

**Cost-Effectiveness Threshold:**
- CADTH typically considers $50,000 per QALY as reference threshold
- **Conclusion:** Price reduction required to achieve acceptable ICER of $50,000/QALY

**Key Cost Drivers:**
1. **Acquisition cost** of tisagenlecleucel (dominant factor)
2. **Administration and hospitalization** costs
3. **Toxicity management** (CRS, neurological events)
4. **Long-term monitoring** and follow-up
5. **Salvage therapy** costs for non-responders

### CADTH Reanalysis Adjustments

CADTH conducted independent reanalyses including:
- Alternative survival extrapolations
- Revised utility values
- Adjusted treatment effect assumptions
- Conservative long-term benefit estimates

## Budget Impact Analysis

### Financial Implications

CADTH assessed the budget impact of reimbursing tisagenlecleucel considering:
1. **Eligible patient population** size
2. **Market uptake** projections
3. **Displacement of existing therapies**
4. **Infrastructure costs** for CAR-T centers

**CADTH Revisions to Budget Impact:**
- Adjusted sponsor estimates for patient numbers
- Revised market share assumptions
- Incorporated real-world uptake patterns

**Table 18 Reference:** CADTH revisions available at:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK599990/table/tr8269861121030306_ch02_t18/

**Key Findings:**
- Significant budget impact expected due to high cost per patient
- Offset by curative potential reducing long-term treatment costs
- Concentrated impact in specialized CAR-T centers
- Need for managed entry agreements

---

## Ethics Review

### Ethical Considerations

CADTH's ethics review (NBK599987) examined:

**Access and Equity:**
- Geographic disparities in CAR-T center availability
- Urban vs. rural access challenges
- Indigenous and remote populations
- Socioeconomic barriers to treatment access

**Resource Allocation:**
- Opportunity cost of high-cost therapy
- Impact on other cancer treatments
- Healthcare system capacity

**Patient Selection:**
- Eligibility criteria fairness
- Clinical vs. social factors in selection
- Transparency in allocation decisions

**Innovation vs. Affordability:**
- Balancing innovation incentives with sustainability
- Precedent for future cell therapies
- Value frameworks for transformative therapies

## Conclusions

### Overall CADTH Position

CADTH's evaluation of tisagenlecleucel demonstrates:

1. **Evidence-Based Approach:**
   - Rigorous clinical and economic evaluation
   - Independent reanalyses of sponsor submissions
   - Transparent reporting of uncertainties

2. **Conditional Recommendations:**
   - Recognition of clinical benefit in selected populations
   - Requirement for price reductions to achieve value
   - Emphasis on appropriate patient selection

3. **System Considerations:**
   - Ethics review highlights equity concerns
   - Budget impact significant but manageable with restrictions
   - Infrastructure requirements addressed

4. **Value for Money:**
   - ICERs exceed traditional thresholds without price reduction
   - Potential for long-term value if durable remissions achieved
   - Managed entry agreements may facilitate access while generating evidence

### Key Messages for Decision-Makers

- Tisagenlecleucel provides important clinical benefit for selected patient populations
- Price reductions are necessary to achieve cost-effectiveness
- Conditional reimbursement with evidence generation is appropriate
- Patient selection and CAR-T center capacity are critical success factors
- Real-world evidence collection should continue to inform reassessments
