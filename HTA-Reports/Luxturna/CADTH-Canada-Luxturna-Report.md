## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

CADTH conducted a comprehensive health technology assessment of voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna) for the treatment of patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) caused by biallelic RPE65 mutations. The CADTH Canadian Drug Expert Committee (CDEC) issued a positive recommendation with conditions for reimbursement.

### Objective
To perform a systematic review of the beneficial and harmful effects of voretigene neparvovec administered as a single dose of 1.5 × 10¹¹ vector genomes in each eye via subretinal injection for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy caused by confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations and who have sufficient viable retinal cells.

## CDEC RECOMMENDATION

### Recommendation Status: **CONDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT**

The CADTH Canadian Drug Expert Committee (CDEC) recommended that **voretigene neparvovec be reimbursed** for the treatment of patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) caused by biallelic retinal pigment epithelium 65 kDa protein (RPE65) mutations, **subject to the conditions** outlined below.

---

## CONDITIONS FOR REIMBURSEMENT

### 1. Patient Eligibility Criteria
Patients must have:
- **Visual acuity worse than 20/60 in both eyes**, AND/OR
- **Visual field less than 20 degrees in any meridian**

### 2. Treatment Limitations

## CLINICAL EVIDENCE REVIEW

### Study Design
The clinical evidence was primarily based on:
- **Study 301:** A randomized, controlled, open-label phase 3 trial
- **Study 101:** A phase 1/2 trial with longer-term follow-up data
- Direct comparison of intervention vs. control groups in the pivotal trial

### Primary Outcome Measures
1. **Multi-Luminance Mobility Testing (MLMT):** Change in mobility at different light levels
2. **Visual Acuity:** Best-corrected visual acuity measurements
3. **Visual Field Testing:** Goldmann visual field assessments
4. **Full-field Light Sensitivity Threshold (FST) Testing**

### Efficacy Results

#### Multi-Luminance Mobility Testing (MLMT)
- At Year 1 in Study 301, a higher proportion of treated patients showed improvement in MLMT scores
- The mean change in bilateral MLMT score showed clinically meaningful improvement in the intervention group
- Improvements were sustained in long-term follow-up data from Study 101

#### Visual Acuity
- **At Year 1 in Study 301:** Limited but measurable improvements in visual acuity were observed
- Visual acuity changes showed high inter-individual variability
- Some patients demonstrated meaningful improvements while others showed minimal change

#### Visual Field
- Improvements in visual field measurements were observed in treated patients
- Results were variable across individual patients
- Long-term data suggested sustained benefit in some patients

### Safety Profile
- The most common adverse events were related to the surgical procedure
- **Ocular adverse events** included:
  - Conjunctival hyperemia
  - Cataracts
  - Increased intraocular pressure
  - Retinal abnormalities
  - Eye inflammation
- Most adverse events were manageable and consistent with the subretinal surgical procedure
- No life-threatening adverse events attributed to the gene therapy

## PHARMACOECONOMIC EVALUATION

### Submitted Economic Model
Novartis submitted a cost-utility analysis comparing voretigene neparvovec with best supportive care (BSC) over a lifetime horizon.

### CADTH Base Case Reanalysis

#### Cost-Effectiveness Results
- **ICER:** $200,477 per QALY gained (compared with best supportive care)
- This ICER exceeds commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds in Canada

#### Price Reduction Scenarios
To achieve commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds:
- To achieve an ICER of **$50,000 per QALY:** Price reduction of **more than 74%** would be required
- To achieve an ICER of **$100,000 per QALY:** Substantial price reduction still needed

### Key Uncertainties in Economic Analysis

1. **Duration of Treatment Effect**
   - The majority of modelled benefits were accrued in time periods beyond when clinical data are available
   - Assumed lifelong duration of effect lacks long-term empirical support
   - Model was highly sensitive to assumptions about treatment durability

2. **Utility Values**
   - Limited disease-specific utility data for RPE65-mediated IRD
   - Utility values were derived from proxy conditions and expert opinion
   - Uncertainty about the relationship between clinical outcomes and quality of life

3. **Natural History Assumptions**
   - Progressive vision loss trajectory in untreated patients modeled with limited data
   - Assumptions about age-related decline in visual function

4. **Generalizability**
   - Trial populations may not fully represent real-world eligible patients
   - Uncertainty about effectiveness across different age groups and disease severity

## BUDGET IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Submitted Budget Impact
The budget impact from the drug plan perspective of reimbursing voretigene neparvovec:
- **Year 1:** $44,354,500
- **Year 2:** $25,787,500
- **Year 3:** $18,567,000

### Key Assumptions
- Estimated prevalent population eligible for treatment
- One-time treatment per patient (both eyes)
- Gradual uptake as eligible patients are identified and treated
- Decreasing annual costs as prevalent cases are treated

### CADTH Appraisal
- Budget impact estimates are sensitive to:
  - Eligible patient population size
  - Treatment uptake rates
  - Price of voretigene neparvovec
- Actual budget impact may vary based on real-world identification of eligible patients

## DISCUSSION AND COMMITTEE CONSIDERATIONS

### Strengths of Evidence
1. **Randomized Controlled Trial:** Study 301 provided direct comparative evidence
2. **Multiple Outcome Measures:** Assessment included objective mobility testing, visual acuity, and visual field
3. **Long-term Follow-up:** Study 101 provided data beyond the 1-year primary endpoint
4. **Consistent Direction of Effect:** Multiple outcomes showed benefit favoring treatment

### Limitations and Uncertainties
1. **Limited Long-term Data:** Durability of effect beyond 3-4 years remains uncertain
2. **Small Sample Sizes:** Due to disease rarity, trial populations were limited
