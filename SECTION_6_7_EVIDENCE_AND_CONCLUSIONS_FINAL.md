## SECTION 6: EVIDENCE DEVELOPMENT PLAN (3-4 pages)

### 6.1 Natural History Study (Immediate Priority)

**Objective:** Establish robust eGFR decline trajectory to serve as external control for clinical trials and inform economic modeling.

**Design:** Retrospective chart review with prospective validation component
- **Sample:** 100-200 patients with ≥3 eGFR measurements over ≥2 years
- **Sources:** Lowe Syndrome Association registry, pediatric nephrology centers (Boston Children's, Great Ormond Street, CHOP, Cincinnati Children's)
- **Geographic scope:** North America, Europe, Australia, Japan (high-quality medical records)

**Primary Endpoints:**
- Mean annual eGFR decline rate (ml/min/1.73m²/year) stratified by age cohort
- Time-to-event outcomes (ESKD, dialysis, transplant, death)
- Identification of progression predictors

**Timeline & Budget:**
- Duration: 12-18 months (12 months data collection, 6 months analysis/publication)
- Cost: $200,000-400,000
- **Critical path:** Complete before Phase 2/3 trial initiation

**Regulatory Impact:**
- FDA/EMA acceptance of external control for single-arm trial design (precedent: Luxturna, Zolgensma)
- Published natural history paper strengthens HTA submissions to NICE, CADTH, G-BA
- Validates model assumptions for cost-effectiveness analysis

### 6.2 Clinical Trial Design Strategy

#### **Phase 1/2 Trial: Safety & Preliminary Efficacy (3-4 Years, $20-40M)**

**Study Design:** Open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation

**Population:**
- Ages 5-16 years (sufficient cooperation with procedures, young enough for disease-modifying benefit)
- eGFR 30-90 ml/min/1.73m² (CKD stages 2-3)
- N=12-18 patients (3 dose cohorts × 4-6 patients)
- Stratified for age, baseline eGFR

**Endpoints:**
- **Primary:** Safety and tolerability over 24 months
- **Secondary:**
  - eGFR slope change vs. baseline (individual patient slopes)
  - Proximal tubulopathy biomarkers (urine phosphate, amino acids, glucose, bicarbonate)
  - Quality of life (EQ-5D-Y, PedsQL)
- **Exploratory:** Neurodevelopmental assessments, ophthalmologic outcomes

**Treatment:** Single IV infusion with pre-medication (corticosteroid, antihistamine) and immunosuppression taper

**Interim Analysis:** After 6 patients complete 12 months
- Go/No-Go criteria: ≤1 Grade ≥3 DLT AND ≥30% eGFR decline slowing vs. natural history

---

#### **Phase 2/3 Pivotal Trial: Registration-Enabling (3-4 Years, $50-150M)**

**Study Design Options:**

**Option 1 (Preferred): Randomized Delayed-Start**
- Arm 1: Gene therapy at Month 0 (n=20-25)
- Arm 2: Gene therapy at Month 12 (n=20-25)
- All patients followed through Year 5
- **Advantage:** Randomized comparison while ensuring all receive therapy

**Option 2: Single-Arm with External Control**
- Treatment arm: n=30-40 (all receive therapy Month 0)
- External control: Natural history cohort from Section 6.1, propensity-score matched
- Acceptable to FDA for ultra-rare diseases with robust natural history data

**Population:**
- Ages 2-20 years (broader range for pediatric label)
- eGFR 30-90 ml/min/1.73m² with documented decline over 6-12 months
- Stratified: Age (<10 vs. ≥10), baseline eGFR (<60 vs. ≥60)
- **Feasibility:** Wave 1 eligible population ~800-1,000 patients; 10-15% trial participation rate achievable with 15-20 global sites

**Sample Size Calculation:**
- Assumptions: Natural history slope -4.0 ml/min/1.73m²/year (SD=1.5), treatment effect 40% reduction, within-patient correlation 0.70, 15% dropout
- **Required:** 40-50 total (randomized) or 30-40 treatment + 60-80 matched external controls (single-arm)
- **Power:** 80-90% to detect 40% difference (α=0.05, two-sided)

**Primary Endpoint: eGFR Slope Over 24 Months**
- **Definition:** Annualized rate of change in eGFR (ml/min/1.73m²/year)
- **Rationale:** Accepted surrogate endpoint by FDA/EMA for CKD drug approvals (SGLT2 inhibitors, finerenone); linked to ESKD onset, cardiovascular events, and mortality
- **Success Criterion:** ≥40% reduction in decline rate vs. natural history (p<0.05)
  - Example: Natural history -4.0 → Treatment -2.4 ml/min/1.73m²/year
  - Translates to 9-year delay in ESKD (cost-effective in Scenario 3)

**Secondary Endpoints:**
- Time to CKD stage progression; ESKD-free survival
- Quality of life (EQ-5D, PedsQL, Family Impact)
- Neurodevelopmental outcomes (Bayley, Wechsler scales)
- Proximal tubulopathy biomarkers

**Safety Monitoring:**
- Hepatotoxicity, hematologic toxicity, immune-mediated AEs, thrombotic microangiopathy
- Data Safety Monitoring Board quarterly reviews
- Long-term follow-up: Annual visits through Year 5, biennial through Year 15

## SECTION 7: CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS (3-4 pages)

### 7.1 Summary of Key Findings

**Clinical Evidence:**
- **Unmet need:** No disease-modifying treatments exist; progressive renal failure causes premature death (median age 30-40 years vs. 75-80 years population)
- **Mechanism:** AAV-based OCRL gene replacement addresses root cause of proximal tubular dysfunction and nephron loss
- **Precedent:** Gene therapy platform validated (Luxturna, Zolgensma, Hemgenix approved by FDA/EMA)

**Epidemiology:**
- **Global prevalence:** ~7,000 patients (58% Asia, 20% Africa, 14% Americas, 8% Europe)
- **Wave 1 eligible population:** ~800-1,000 patients in USA/EU at launch (2030)
- **Annual incidence at treatment age:** ~50-70 patients/year globally

**Economic Analysis (Lifetime Markov Model):**
| Scenario | eGFR Decline | ICER | QALY Gain | ESKD Delay | Interpretation |
|----------|--------------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Best-case** | Stabilized | $328K/QALY | +6.88 | Prevented | Highly cost-effective |
| **Middle** | 70% slowing | $639K/QALY | +3.94 | 16 years | Cost-effective (ultra-rare) |
| **Conservative** | 40% slowing | $1.45M/QALY | +1.94 | 9 years | Risk-sharing needed |

- **Pricing strategy:** $2.5-3.5M optimal range (benchmarked to Zolgensma $2.1M, Hemgenix $3.5M)
- **Cost offsets:** ESKD prevention saves $1.0-2.0M lifetime medical costs (dialysis $87-99K/year, transplant $190-260K Year 1)
- **Budget impact manageable:** UK £8-17M/year steady-state; US $30-69M/year (small population)

**Competitive Landscape:**
- **No competing therapies:** ClinicalTrials.gov shows zero active Lowe syndrome trials
- **5-7 year first-mover advantage** to establish treatment standard and capture market
- **Orphan drug exclusivity:** 7 years (FDA), 10 years (EMA)

### 7.2 Strengths for HTA Success

1. **Quantifiable objective endpoint** (eGFR slope) reduces regulatory uncertainty vs. subjective outcomes
2. **Severe unmet need** (100% fatal without treatment) supports premium pricing and HST pathways
3. **Ultra-rare disease flexibility** enables cost-effectiveness thresholds up to $500K-1M/QALY (ICER), £100-300K/QALY (NICE)
4. **One-time curative treatment** eliminates chronic medication burden; high patient/caregiver value
5. **ESKD cost prevention** provides substantial economic offset ($1-2M lifetime savings)
6. **Validated epidemiology** (peer-reviewed population model) provides robust market access predictions
7. **Regulatory precedent** from Luxturna, Zolgensma, Hemgenix demonstrating FDA/EMA acceptance of small trials and high pricing

---

### 7.3 Key Risks & Risk Mitigation

**Pre-Clinical Uncertainties:**
- **Risk:** No efficacy data; economic model may not translate to clinical benefit
- **Mitigation:**
  - Scenario-based modeling (best/middle/conservative cases)
  - Outcomes-based pricing (refund 50% if <40% eGFR decline slowing)
  - Managed entry agreements with evidence development requirements

**Utility Mapping:**
- **Risk:** Lowe-specific QoL differs from mapped CKD utilities, invalidating QALY estimates
- **Mitigation:** Prospective QoL study (Section 6.2) collecting EQ-5D-Y in 50-100 patients before HTA submissions

**Long-Term Durability:**
- **Risk:** Gene expression may decline after 5-10 years; eGFR decline resumes
- **Mitigation:** 15-year registry mandatory enrollment; re-dosing protocols if efficacy wanes

**Market Access Delays:**
- **Risk:** HTA reviews extend time-to-reimbursement; revenue delayed
- **Mitigation:** Early NICE/CADTH/ICER engagement (Year -2); adaptive trial design addressing payer evidence requirements

**AAV Immunogenicity:**
- **Risk:** Pre-existing immunity may exclude patients; immune responses emerge years post-treatment
- **Mitigation:** Pre-treatment antibody screening; immunosuppression protocols; alternative AAV serotypes for re-treatment
