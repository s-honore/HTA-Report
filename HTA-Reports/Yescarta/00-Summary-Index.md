## Common Themes Across All HTAs

### Clinical Evidence
All agencies based recommendations primarily on:
- **ZUMA-1 study:** Pivotal phase 2 single-arm trial (111 patients)
- **Objective Response Rate:** 82% (54% complete response)
- **Durability:** Potential for long-term remission in responders
- **Real-world evidence:** Supportive data from registries

### Safety Profile
Consistently identified safety concerns:
- **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS):** ~93% any grade, ~13% severe
- **Neurotoxicity:** ~64% any grade, ~28% severe
- **Infections:** Common due to B-cell aplasia
- **Cytopenias:** Frequent and can be prolonged
- **Manageable:** With appropriate monitoring at specialized centers

### Economic Considerations
- **Very high cost:** One-time treatment cost >$400,000-$500,000
- **Value proposition:** Potential for durable remission/cure in heavily pretreated population
- **Budget impact:** Significant despite small patient numbers
- **Cost offsets:** Reduced subsequent therapy costs if successful
- **Price negotiations:** Several jurisdictions required price reductions or special arrangements

### Implementation Requirements
All agencies emphasized:
- **Specialized centers only:** CAR-T certified treatment facilities
- **Infrastructure needs:** Apheresis, ICU, intensive monitoring capabilities
- **Trained personnel:** Healthcare professionals experienced in CAR-T toxicity management
- **Manufacturing time:** 3-4 weeks typical, requiring bridging therapy consideration
- **Registry participation:** Real-world evidence collection mandatory
- **Quality assurance:** Ongoing monitoring and reporting

### Patient Population
Consistent eligibility across jurisdictions:
- Adults with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma
- After 2 or more lines of systemic therapy (some jurisdictions exploring second-line)
- Adequate performance status and organ function
- CD19-positive disease
- No active uncontrolled infections or severe comorbidities

---

## Key Differences Between Jurisdictions

### Funding Mechanisms
- **UK (NICE):** NHS routine commissioning with patient access scheme
- **Canada (CADTH):** Provincial drug plans with price reduction requirement
- **Germany:** Statutory health insurance after orphan drug price negotiation
- **France:** National health insurance with outcomes-based elements
- **Australia:** Highly Specialised Therapies Program (joint Commonwealth-State funding)

### Assessment Frameworks
- **NICE:** Technology appraisal with QALY-based cost-effectiveness and end-of-life criteria
- **CADTH:** Full reimbursement review with clinical and economic evaluation
- **IQWiG:** Orphan drug benefit assessment (simplified - added benefit deemed proven)
- **HAS:** Transparency Commission evaluation (SMR and ASMR ratings)
- **MSAC:** Technology assessment (not traditional pharmaceutical assessment)

### Price Transparency
- **Most jurisdictions:** Final negotiated prices are confidential (commercial-in-confidence)
- **Canada:** Published list price ($485,021 CAD) but required reduction amount confidential
- **Discounts and rebates:** Generally confidential but acknowledged in all jurisdictions

### Therapeutic Positioning
- **Most agencies:** Third-line or later treatment
- **Canada (CADTH):** Emphasis on early relapsing patients (within 12 months of first-line)
- **NICE TA895:** Separate assessment for second-line indication (post-ZUMA-7 trial)
- **All:** Recognition that positioning may evolve with emerging evidence

**Population:**
- Median age: 58 years (range 23-76)
- Relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL
- Median 3 prior lines of therapy
- 77% refractory to last line
- 21% prior autologous SCT

**Key Results:**
- **ORR:** 82% (95% CI: 73%-90%)
- **Complete Response:** 54% (95% CI: 44%-64%)
- **Median Duration of Response:** 11.1 months (not reached for CR patients)
- **18-month OS:** 52%
- **18-month PFS:** 44%

**Long-term Follow-up:**
- Durable responses maintained
- Survival curves showing plateau (suggesting cure potential)
- 4-year follow-up data available

### Supporting Evidence: ZUMA-7

**Design:**
- Randomized controlled trial
- Axicabtagene ciloleucel vs. standard of care (salvage chemo + ASCT)
- Early relapsing patients (refractory or relapse <12 months after first-line)

**Key Results:**
- **Event-free survival:** HR 0.398, p<0.0001 (median 8.3 vs 2.0 months)
- **Response rates:** ORR 83% vs 50%; CR 65% vs 32%
- **Overall survival:** Trend toward improvement (crossover confounds analysis)

**Impact:**
- Supports use in second-line setting (earlier than original indication)
- Separate assessments by some agencies (e.g., NICE TA895)
- May shift therapeutic positioning in future

### Real-World Evidence

**Registries:**
- CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research)

**Findings:**
- Generally consistent with trial results
- Broader patient population in real-world setting
- Safety profile as expected
- Manufacturing and logistics successfully implemented
- Timeframes: ~5-7 weeks from apheresis to infusion
