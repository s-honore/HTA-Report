## Executive Summary

The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) conducted a comprehensive health technology assessment of betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel) gene therapy for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The **independent appraisal committee unanimously determined** (12-0 vote) that the evidence is adequate to demonstrate that beti-cel provides a **net health benefit superior to standard clinical management**.

**Key Finding**: 89% of patients who received beti-cel treatment no longer required transfusions during follow-up (average 42 months), representing a potentially curative one-time therapy for a condition that traditionally requires lifelong medical management.

**Cost-Effectiveness Determination**: At a modeled price of $2.1 million with outcomes-based agreements, beti-cel meets cost-effectiveness thresholds, largely because it offsets the very high lifetime costs of standard care for TDT.

## Clinical Evidence Review

### Clinical Effectiveness - Committee Vote

**Question**: Is the evidence adequate to demonstrate that the net health benefit of beti-cel is superior to that provided by standard clinical management for patients with TDT?

**Vote Result**: **12 YES - 0 NO** (Unanimous)

**Interpretation**: The committee had high confidence that beti-cel provides clinically meaningful benefits beyond what standard care offers.

### Primary Efficacy Outcome: Transfusion Independence

**Key Result: 89% Transfusion Independence Rate**

- **89% of patients** who received beti-cel treatment no longer required regular blood transfusions
- **Average follow-up**: 42 months (3.5 years)
- **Durability**: **None** of the 89% who achieved transfusion independence reverted to requiring transfusions during the follow-up period

**Clinical Significance:**
- Transfusion independence represents a life-changing outcome
- Eliminates burden of hospital visits every 2-4 weeks for transfusions
- Removes need for iron chelation therapy
- Reduces risk of transfusion-related complications
- Dramatically improves quality of life

### Study Design and Evidence Base

**Study Characteristics:**
- Multiple clinical trials evaluated, including HGB-204, HGB-205, HGB-207, and HGB-212
- **Single-arm, open-label studies** (typical for gene therapy trials)
- Small sample sizes reflecting rare disease population
- Follow-up ranging from months to several years

**Evidence Quality Considerations:**
- Lack of randomized controlled trials noted
- Consistent results across multiple studies strengthened confidence
- Large effect size (89% transfusion independence) reduces concern about bias
- Real-world data collection ongoing

### Secondary Outcomes

**Quality of Life Improvements:**
- Significant reduction in treatment burden
- Freedom from frequent hospital visits
- Improved ability to work, attend school, and engage in normal activities
- Reduced anxiety about managing chronic disease

**Safety Profile:**
- Adverse events primarily related to conditioning regimen (expected)
- Engraftment generally successful
- No unexpected long-term safety signals during available follow-up
- Ongoing monitoring for late effects continues

## Treatment Context and Unmet Need

### Current Treatment Landscape

**Standard Clinical Management for TDT:**
1. **Regular blood transfusions** every 2-4 weeks for life
2. **Iron chelation therapy** to prevent organ damage from iron overload
3. **Monitoring and management** of complications:
   - Cardiac complications from iron overload
   - Endocrine dysfunction
   - Growth delays in children
   - Osteoporosis
   - Liver disease

**Curative Option:**
- **Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation** from matched related donor
- Only available for **minority of patients** (most lack matched donors)
- Carries risks of graft-versus-host disease and rejection
- Age limitations for transplant eligibility

### Significance of Beti-cel

**ICER's Assessment:**
> "Previously, a minority of patients had access to curative allogeneic bone marrow transplant; beti-cel provides an additional potentially curative option for many patients with TDT."

**Key Advantages:**
- Expands access to curative therapy beyond those with matched donors
- Uses patient's own genetically modified cells (autologous)
- Avoids graft-versus-host disease risk
- Single treatment with potential for lifelong benefit

---

## Uncertainties and Limitations

### Evidence Gaps

**1. Long-term Durability**
- ICER noted: "New potentially curative therapies for beta-thalassemia bring the promise of considerable lifetime benefit, but there also remains **substantial uncertainty regarding longer-term safety and the durability of benefits**."
- Available follow-up of 42 months average is relatively short given TDT is a lifetime condition
- Need for data extending to 10+ years to confirm permanent cure

**2. Late Safety Signals**
- Theoretical risk of insertional mutagenesis from viral vector
- Very long-term monitoring needed (decades)
- No concerning signals to date, but continued vigilance required

**3. Real-World Effectiveness**
- Clinical trial results may not fully reflect real-world outcomes
- Patient selection in trials may differ from broader TDT population
- Need for post-market surveillance and patient registries

**4. Applicability to All Genotypes**
- Evidence primarily in non-β0/β0 genotypes
- Limited data in most severe genotypes
- May not work equally well across all genetic variants

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

### Economic Model Overview

**Modeled Price**: **$2.1 million** (upfront, per patient)

**Comparator**: Standard clinical management (lifelong transfusions + chelation)

**Time Horizon**: Lifetime (to capture all costs and benefits)

### Key Cost-Effectiveness Finding

**ICER Conclusion:**
> "Beti-cel is cost-effective at a high price in part because it **offsets current very high costs of care**."

**Why Gene Therapy Can Be Cost-Effective Despite High Price:**
1. **Offsets lifetime transfusion costs**: Regular transfusions every 2-4 weeks for life
2. **Eliminates chelation therapy costs**: Expensive medications taken daily or multiple times weekly
3. **Reduces complication management costs**: Cardiac, endocrine, hepatic complications
4. **Reduces indirect costs**: Work/school absences, caregiver burden
5. **One-time cost vs. ongoing costs**: Upfront investment vs. 50+ years of expenses

### Outcomes-Based Agreement Modeling

**Innovative Payment Model Analyzed:**
- **80% payback option** for patients who do not achieve transfusion independence
- Aligns manufacturer revenue with patient outcomes
- Reduces payer financial risk
- Assumed upfront price: **$2.1 million**

**Structure:**
- Full payment if patient achieves sustained transfusion independence
- 80% refund to payer if patient does not achieve transfusion independence
- Creates accountability for outcomes

**Impact on Cost-Effectiveness:**
- Outcomes-based agreement improves cost-effectiveness ratio
- Reduces uncertainty burden on payers
- Allows higher upfront price while protecting against treatment failures

### Cost-Effectiveness Ratios

While specific ICERs (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) were not provided in available summaries, ICER's determination that beti-cel is "cost-effective at a high price" suggests:

- ICERs likely fell **below ICER's thresholds** ($100,000-$150,000 per QALY)
- Sensitivity analyses probably showed robustness across reasonable parameter ranges
- Long-term cost savings offset the substantial upfront investment

### Budget Impact

**Factors Limiting Budget Impact:**
1. **Small eligible population** (rare disease)
2. **Patients spread over many payers** (diluted impact per payer)
3. **Gradual uptake** over time (not all patients treated immediately)
4. **Cost offsets** begin immediately (elimination of transfusion/chelation costs)

## Policy Recommendations

### ICER Committee Policy Recommendation

**Key Recommendation:**
> "Payers should use the **FDA label as the guide to coverage policy** without seeking to unduly narrow coverage using clinical trial eligibility criteria."

**Rationale:**
- FDA approval based on comprehensive benefit-risk assessment
- Clinical trial eligibility criteria often overly restrictive for real-world use
- Patients outside narrow trial criteria may still benefit
- Avoid creating barriers to access for eligible patients

### Additional Policy Considerations

**1. Coverage Policy Design**
- Align coverage with FDA-approved indication
- Avoid unnecessary prior authorization hurdles for clearly eligible patients
- Consider expedited review for time-sensitive cases
- Ensure coverage for pre-treatment evaluation and post-treatment monitoring

**2. Payment Model Innovation**
- Consider outcomes-based agreements to align payment with results
- Explore installment payment options to spread costs over time
- Develop risk-sharing arrangements between payers and manufacturers
- Create multi-payer collaborations for rare disease therapies

**3. Access and Equity**
- Ensure access not limited by geography (treatment at specialized centers)
- Address health equity concerns in gene therapy access
- Consider coverage for related costs (travel, lodging, lost wages)
- Monitor for disparities in treatment uptake

**4. Evidence Development**
- Require participation in patient registries as condition of coverage
- Support long-term follow-up studies
- Share real-world evidence among stakeholders
- Periodically reassess value as more data accumulates

## Comparison to Alternative Curative Options

### Allogeneic HSC Transplant vs. Beti-cel Gene Therapy

| Feature | Allogeneic HSC Transplant | Beti-cel Gene Therapy |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Cell Source** | Matched related donor | Patient's own cells (autologous) |
| **Donor Requirement** | Matched donor must be available | No donor needed |
| **GVHD Risk** | Significant risk | No risk (autologous) |
| **Immunosuppression** | Required long-term | Not required |
| **Rejection Risk** | Possible | Not applicable |
| **Success Rate** | High when matched donor available | 89% transfusion independence |
| **Availability** | Limited (minority have matched donors) | Available to most eligible patients |
| **Age Limitations** | Generally <35 years, some flexibility | Generally <35 years in trials |

**ICER's Position:**
- Both are legitimate curative options
- Beti-cel expands access to those without matched donors
- Choice depends on individual patient circumstances
- Not necessarily one superior to the other - complementary options
