## Conclusion

The CADTH Clinical Review Report for onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma) concluded that the therapy is clinically effective in improving survival and motor function in pediatric patients with 5q SMA, particularly those with SMA type 1. While the clinical benefits are substantial, the review identified important limitations including:

1. Lack of randomized controlled trial data
2. Uncertainty about long-term durability of effect
3. Absence of direct comparative effectiveness data
4. High cost with cost-effectiveness exceeding commonly accepted thresholds

The review recognized that onasemnogene abeparvovec addresses a significant unmet medical need in a devastating pediatric disease, but recommended careful patient selection, comprehensive monitoring, and ongoing data collection to address remaining uncertainties.

Provincial reimbursement decisions must weigh the substantial clinical benefits against the high cost and remaining uncertainties about long-term effectiveness and comparative value relative to other available therapies.
